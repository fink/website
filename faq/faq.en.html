<h1 style="text-align: center;">The Fink F.A.Q.</h1>
    <p>This is the list of frequently asked questions about Fink. Like in most FAQs, some questions are taken from real life and some are made up. It's really more like a documentation written in an ad-hoc, question and answer style.</p>
    <p>The FAQ consists of several pages, one for each section. All questions are listed and linked in the table of contents below.</p>

    <a name="general.what">
      <div class="question"><p><b>Q1.1: What is Fink?</b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> Fink wants to bring more Unix software to Mac OS X, which results in two main goals:</p><p>Goal number one is porting software to Mac OS X. That means we take commodity Open Source Unix software and fix whatever is necessary so that it will compile and run on Mac OS X. Sometimes that's easy, but it can also be very hard or even impossible for some packages. We're trying to provide tools and documentation to make this easier.</p><p>Goal number two is making the results available to casual users.  For this, we build a distribution using package management tools ported over from Linux, namely <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">dpkg</tt> and <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">apt-get</tt>, written by and for the  <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian GNU/Linux</a> project. The binary distribution uses the <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">.deb</tt> package format. For building packages from source, we have our own tool, named <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">fink</tt>, which creates those <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">.deb</tt> package files.</p></div>
    </a>
    <a name="general.naming">
      <div class="question"><p><b>Q1.2: What does the name Fink stand for?</b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> 	Nothing, it's just a name. It's not even an acronym.</p><p>	Well, actually Fink is the German name for Finch, a kind of bird. I was looking for a name for the project, and the name of the OS, Darwin, led me to think about Charles Darwin, the Galapagos Islands and evolution. I remembered a piece about the so-called Darwin Finches and their beaks from school, and well, that's it...</p></div>
    </a>
    <a name="general.bsd-ports">
      <div class="question"><p><b>Q1.3: 	How is Fink different from the BSD port mechanism (this includes OpenPackages and GNU-Darwin)?
		</b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> 	Some main advantages:</p><ul>
          <li>
            <p> It's written in Perl, not make/shell. Thus it  doesn't rely on special features only found in BSD make. There is no need to flag packages that need GNU make to build.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p> dpkg provides sophisticated management for binary packages - smooth updating, special handling for configuration files, virtual packages and other advanced dependencies. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p> Fink doesn't install into /usr/local unless explicitly requested and doesn't require fiddling with /usr/bin/make or other system-provided commands. That makes it safer to use and reduces interference with Mac OS X and third-party packages to a minimum.</p>
          </li>
        </ul></div>
    </a>
    <a name="general.usr-local">
      <div class="question"><p><b>Q1.4: Why doesn't Fink install into /usr/local?</b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> 	There are several reasons, but the common line is "because breakage will occur".</p><p>	Reason One: Third-party software. /usr/local is the well-established place to put software that is not part of the system shipped by the original vendor. This means that it is a good place to put stuff. However, it also means that other people will put stuff there, too. Most install routines will just overwrite what's there - this also applies to dpkg. One can, of course, choose not to install third-party software in /usr/local. Unfortunately, most installers don't tell you beforehand what they will install where.</p><p>	Reason Two: /usr/local/bin is in the default PATH. This means that your shell will find the installed programs without additional measures. But it also means that you do have to take additional measures if you do not want to use the programs. In extreme cases, this can also affect the system itself - many parts depend on shell scripts.</p><p>	Reason Three: The compiler tool chain searches /usr/local by default. The compiler searches /usr/local/include for header files and the linker searches /usr/local/lib for libraries. Again, this is sometimes a welcome convenience, but it's very hard to disable should the need arise. You can easily disable the compiler by putting a garbage file called <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">stdio.h</tt> into /usr/local/include.</p><p>	All that said, it is possible to install Fink into /usr/local. The installation script will warn you explicitly, but proceed once you acknowledge that you're doing this at your own risk.</p></div>
    </a>
    <a name="general.why-sw">
      <div class="question"><p><b>Q1.5: Then why did you choose /sw?</b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b>  That choice is quite arbitrary, but is likely to stay for the foreseeable future for practical (upgrade) issues as well as the fact that it's safe from conflicting with other packaging systems.</p></div>
    </a>
  <h2><a name="relations">2 Relations with Other Projects</a></h2>
    
    
    <a name="relations.upstream">
      <div class="question"><p><b>Q2.1: Do you contribute your patches back to the upstream maintainers?</b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> We're trying to. Sometimes sending patches back is easy and  everyone is happy once the next release of the package is out. Unfortunately with most packages it's not that easy. Some common problems:</p><ul>
          <li>The Fink package maintainer is very busy and doesn't have the time to send the patch and accompanying explanations to the upstream
          maintainers.</li>
          <li>The upstream maintainers reject the patch. There are lots of valid reasons for this. Most upstream maintainers have a strong interest in clean code, clean configure checks, and compatibility with other platforms.</li>
          <li>The upstream maintainers accept the patch, but it takes some weeks or months until they release a new version of their package.</li>
          <li>The package has been abandoned by the original authors and there will be no new releases into which the patch could be merged.</li>
        </ul></div>
    </a>
    <a name="relations.debian">
      <div class="question"><p><b>Q2.2: What is your relation with the Debian project? Are you porting Debian Linux to Mac OS X?</b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> There is no formal relation between Fink and <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a>. Fink is <b>not</b> a port  of the Debian GNU/Linux distribution. We have ported Debian's package management tools (dpkg, dselect, apt-get) though, and use these tools and the .deb binary package format. The actual packages are tailor-made for Mac OS X / Darwin and don't use the Debian source package  format.</p></div>
    </a>
    <a name="relations.apple">
      <div class="question"><p><b>Q2.3: What is your relation with Apple?</b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> 
          <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> is aware of Fink and has given us some support as part of their Open Source relations efforts. In the summer and fall of 2001, they provided us with pre-release seeds of new Mac OS X versions in the hope that Fink packages can be adapted in time for the release. Quote:  <b>"Hopefully it underscores the commitment that many suspect we're not willing to provide. We'll get better at the open source game over time."</b> Thanks Apple!</p></div>
    </a>
    <a name="relations.darwinports">
      <div class="question"><p><b>Q2.4: What is your relation with Darwinports?</b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> Darwinports and Fink are complementary projects. There is some overlap between the two projects, and several people contribute to both the Fink and DarwinPorts projects. For example, Benjamin Reed is doing the KDE packages for both. Darwinports and Fink are free to make use of each other's patches, and we have discussed collaboration on a new dependency engine.</p><p>DarwinPorts started from scratch to try a different approach to a packaging system.

    <a name="mirrors.when-use">
      <div class="question"><p><b>Q3.1: What are Fink Mirrors?</b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> Fink mirrors are rsync servers mirroring the current and stable description files that Fink uses to build packages from source.</p></div>
    </a>
    <a name="mirrors.why">
      <div class="question"><p><b>Q3.2: Why should I use rsync mirrors?</b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> Rsync is a very fast protocol. It will update the description files faster than the old CVS update method. Furthermore, CVS updates are  always done from sourceforge.net while rsync updates can be done from a mirror close to you.</p></div>
    </a>
    <a name="mirrors.where">
      <div class="question"><p><b>Q3.3: Where can I find more information about Fink mirrors?</b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> All Fink mirrors are consolidated under the finkmirrors.net domain. The Web-Site at http://finkmirrors.net/ has more information.</p></div>

      <div class="question"><p><b>Q3.4: I cannot connect to rsync server, what should I do?</b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> Sometimes very strict firewalls forbid you to connect to rsync services. If that is the case simply continue using the CVS  method</p></div>
    </a>
    <a name="mirrors.otherinfogone">
      <div class="question"><p><b>Q3.5: I have switched to the rsync method now all info files from the unused trees are gone</b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> This is normal. The rsync update method will only update your active tree, e.g. 10.3, and it will also delete the CVS subdirectories.</p></div>
    </a>
    <a name="mirrors.howswitch">
      <div class="question"><p><b>Q3.6: How can I switch back and forth between methods?</b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> By using fink selfupdate-rsync or fink selfupdate-cvs to switch to rsync or CVS, respectively.</p></div>
    </a>
    <a name="mirrors.Master">
      <div class="question"><p><b>Q3.7: What is a Distfiles mirror?</b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> Sometimes it is hard to fetch a certain version of sources from the
		Internet. Distfile mirrors hold and mirror the source packages needed
		by fink to build its source packages.</p></div>

        but 99% of the programs will stop working when you do. That's because
        basically all Unix software depends on hardcoded paths to find data

        (or wherever you chose to install it), except for a few exceptions. 
        Thus, in order to get rid of Fink, enter this command:</p><pre>
fink remove --recursive daemonic xinitrc
sudo rm -rf /sw
		</pre><p>If you aren't planning to reinstall Fink you also will want to
        remove the "<tt style="white-space: nowrap;">source /sw/bin/init.csh</tt>" line you added to
        your <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">.cshrc</tt> file or the "<tt style="white-space: nowrap;">source
        /sw/bin/init.sh</tt>" line you added to your
        <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">.bashrc</tt> file, whichever is appropriate to your
        setup, using a text editor.  If you had the <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">xinitrc</tt> package
        installed, then you will want to restore the original 
        <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">/usr/X11/lib/X11/xinit/xinitrc</tt>, which has been backed up
        as <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">/usr/X11/lib/X11/xinit/xinitrc.YYYYMMDDhhmm</tt>, 
        i.e. the extension has a year, month, date, hour, and minute).  If you have more
        than one of these, the original one normally does <b>not</b> mention 
        <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">sys-xinitrc-fink</tt>.  Once you've found the right one, you can use</p><pre>sudo mv /usr/X11/lib/X11/xinit/xinitrc.YYYYMMDDhhmm  \

      <div class="question"><p><b>Q5.7: The package database at the website lists package xxx, but apt-get
        and dselect know nothing about it. Who's lying?</b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> Both are correct. The <a href="http://pdb.finkproject.org/pdb/">package database</a> knows
        about every package, including those that are still in the unstable
        section. The <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">dselect</tt> and <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">apt-get</tt> tools on
        the other hand only know about the packages available as precompiled
        binary packages. Many packages are not available in precompiled form
        through these tools for a variety of reasons. A package must be in the
        "stable" section of the latest point release to be considered, and it
        must pass additional checks for policy compliance as well as licensing
        and patent restrictions.</p><p>If you want to install a package that is not available via
        <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">dselect</tt> / <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">apt-get</tt>, you have to compile it
        from source using <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">fink install <b>packagename</b>
          </tt>.
        Make sure you have the Developer Tools installed before you try this.
        (If there is no installer for the Developer Tools in your
        <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">/Applications</tt> folder, you can get them from the <a href="http://connect.apple.com/">Apple Developer Connection</a>

        fink command just says 'no package found'. How can I install it?</b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> First make sure you understand what 'unstable' means. Packages in
        the unstable tree are not in stable for any number of reasons.  It
        could be because there are known issues, validation errors, or just
        not enough people giving feedback that the package works for them.
        For that reason, Fink doesn't search the unstable tree by
        default.</p><p>If you do enable unstable, please remember to e-mail the
        maintainer if something works (or even if it doesn't). Feedback from
        users like you is what we use to determine if something is ready for
        stable! To find out the maintainer of a package, run <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">fink info
        <b>packagename</b></tt>.</p><p>For <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">fink-0.26</tt> and later:  If you run
	<tt style="white-space: nowrap;">fink configure</tt> one of the questions will ask whether you
	want to turn the unstable trees on.  </p><p>To configure Fink to use unstable
	when you have an earlier version of the <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">fink</tt> tool than
	<b>0.26</b>, edit
        <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">/sw/etc/fink.conf</tt>, and add <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">unstable/main</tt>
        and <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">unstable/crypto</tt> to the <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">Trees:</tt> line.</p><p>If you use Fink Commander, then there is a Preference to use unstable
	packages.</p><p>None of these options actually download the unstable tree's package
	descriptions.You'll need to turn on <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">rsync</tt> or
	<tt style="white-space: nowrap;">cvs</tt> updating to do this, which is not set up by default on a new
	Fink installation.  The following command sequence will set you up on
	a new Fink installation:</p><pre>fink selfupdate</pre><p>followed by</p><pre>fink selfupdate-rsync</pre><p>or</p><pre>fink selfupdate-cvs</pre><p>and then</p><pre>fink index -f
fink scanpackages</pre><p><b>Note:</b>  There are Fink Commander analogs for everything except
	<tt style="white-space: nowrap;">fink index -f</tt>.  You will have to use the command line for that.</p><p>If you're already set up with <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">rsync</tt> or <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">cvs</tt>
	updating, then the following
	command sequence (or the Fink Commander analogs) will suffice:</p><pre>
fink selfupdate
fink index
fink scanpackages
	</pre><p>If you're not sure what your update method is, check
	<tt style="white-space: nowrap;">fink --version</tt> in at a command line
	and see if that mentions <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">cvs</tt> or <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">rsync</tt>.</p><p>If you don't want to install any more from unstable than
        your specific package(s) and its (their) dependencies, (and any base packages
	that got updated) don't use the

        cause unforeseen issues that make it difficult to debug problems when
        they do arise.</p><p>That said, if you only want one or two specific packages, and nothing
        else from unstable, then you need to switch over to CVS updating (i.e.
        use <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">fink selfupdate-cvs</tt>), because rsync only updates the
        trees that are active in your <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">fink.conf</tt>. Edit
        <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">/sw/etc/fink.conf</tt> and add <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">local/main</tt>
        to the <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">Trees:</tt> line, if not present. Then you'll need to
        run <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">fink selfupdate</tt> to download the package description
        files. Now copy the relevant <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">.info</tt> files (and their

        <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">/sw/fink/dists/unstable/main/finkinfo</tt> (or

        <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">/sw/fink/dists/local/main/finkinfo</tt>. However, note
        that your package may depend on other packages (or particular
        versions) which are also only in unstable. You will have to move their
        <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">.info</tt> and <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">.patch</tt> files as well. After you
        move all of the files, make sure to run <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">fink index</tt>, so
        that Fink's record of available packages is updated. Once you're done

        and infinite hangs during patching) when using Fink to compile

      <div class="question"><p><b>Q5.15: I'm trying to install a package, but Fink can't download it. The
        download site shows a later version number of the package than what
        Fink has. What do I do?</b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> The package sources get moved around by the upstream sites when new
        versions are released.</p><p>The first thing you should do is run <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">fink selfupdate</tt>.
        It may be that the package maintainer has already fixed this, and you
        will get an updated package description with either a more recent
        version or a revised download URL.</p><p>If this doesn't work, most sources are available on <a href="http://distfiles.master.finkmirrors.net/">http://distfiles.master.finkmirrors.net/</a>
        (thanks to Rob Braun) , and you can run <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">fink configure</tt> to
        choose to search "Master" source mirrors so that Fink will
        automatically look there.</p><p>If this doesn't work, please let the package maintainer (available
        from "<tt style="white-space: nowrap;">fink describe <b>packagename</b>
          </tt>") know that the
        URL is broken; not all maintainers read the mailing lists all of the
        time.</p><p>To get a usable source, first try hunting around the remote site in
        other directories for the same version of the source that Fink wants
        (e.g. in an "old" directory). Keep in mind, though, that some remote
        sites like to trash the old versions of their packages. If the
        official site doesn't have it, then try a web search--sometimes there
        are unofficial sites that have the tarball you want. Another place to
        look is <a href="http://us.dl.sourceforge.net/fink/direct_download/source/">http://us.dl.sourceforge.net/fink/direct_download/source/</a>,
        which is where Fink stores sourcefiles from packages that have been
        released in binary form. If all of the above fail, then you might
        consider posting on the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum=fink-users">fink-users
        mailing list</a> to ask if anybody has the old source available to
        give you.</p><p>Once you locate the proper source tarball, download it manually,
        and then move the file into your Fink source location (i.e. for a
        default Fink install, "<tt style="white-space: nowrap;">sudo mv <b>package-source.tar.gz</b>
        /sw/src/</tt>". Then use '<tt style="white-space: nowrap;">fink install <b>packagename</b>
          </tt>' as normal.</p><p>If you can't get the source file, then you'll have to wait for the
        maintainer to deal with the problem. They may either post a link to
        the old source, or update the .info and .patch files to use the newer
        version.</p></div>

      <div class="question"><p><b>Q5.16: I get "command not found" errors when I run Fink or anything that I
        installed with Fink.</b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> If this always happens, then you may have inadvertently
        modified (or failed to modify) your startup scripts. Run the
        <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">/sw/bin/pathsetup.sh</tt> script in a terminal
        window. This program will attempt to detect your default shell
        and add a command to load Fink's shell initialization script
        into your shell's configuration. You'll then need to open a
        new terminal session so that your environment settings are
        loaded. <b>Note:</b> Some older versions fink called this
        script <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">pathsetup.command</tt> instead
        of <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">pathsetup.sh</tt>. Alternately, you can run
        the <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">pathsetup.app</tt> application on the Fink
        binary distribution disk image.</p><p>On the other hand, if you only have problems in the Apple X11
        terminal, the easy solution is to modify the "Terminal" entry in the X11 Application menu via the <b>Applications-&gt;Customize Menu... </b>option.  Instead of just</p><pre>xterm</pre><p>change the command field to read</p><pre>xterm -ls</pre><p><tt style="white-space: nowrap;">ls</tt> here means <q>login shell</q>, and the result is that your full login setup gets used (just like the OS X Terminal).</p><p>These <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">/sw/bin/init.*</tt> scripts do much
	more than just add <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">/sw/bin</tt> to your PATH.
	Many packages will not work correctly without these additional
	actions.</p></div>

      <div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> This usually is due to a problem in your PATH. In a terminal window
        type:</p><pre>printenv PATH</pre><p>If <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">/sw/sbin</tt> doesn't appear at all, then you

        there are other directories ahead of it (e.g.

        reorder your PATH so that <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">/sw/sbin</tt> is near the
        beginning. Or if you really need the other directory to be before

If you have the .deb file

        is OK. If the output is something other than directories and files, or
        if you don't have the .deb file, you can still proceed because the
        error doesn't interfere with builds.</p><p>If you have been installing from the binary distribution or you
        know for sure that the version in the binary distribution is the same
        as what you have installed (e.g. by checking the <a href="http://pdb.finkproject.org/pdb/index.php">package
        database</a>), then you can get a .deb file by running <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">sudo
        apt-get install --reinstall --download-only <b>packagename</b>

        rebuild <b>packagename</b>
          </tt>, but it won't install yet.</p><p>Once you have a valid .deb file, then you can reconstitute the
        file. First become root by using <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">sudo -s</tt> (enter your
        administrative user password if necessary), and then use the following
        command:</p><pre>dpkg -c <b>full-path-to-debfile</b> | awk '{if ($6 == "./"){ print "/."; } \
else if (substr($6, length($6), 1) == "/")\
{print substr($6, 2, length($6) - 2); } \
else { print substr($6, 2, length($6) - 1);}}'\

else { print substr($6, 2, length($6) - 1);}}' \ 
&gt; /sw/var/lib/dpkg/info/libgnomeui2-dev.list</pre><p>What this does is to extract the contents of the .deb file, remove

      <div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> If you're seeing this:</p><pre>Unknown option: 1 Usage: head [-options] &lt;url&gt;...</pre><p>followed by a list of option descriptions, you have a broken
        <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">head</tt> executable. This happens when you install the Perl
        libwww library on an HFS+ system volume. It tries to create a new
        command <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">/usr/bin/HEAD</tt>, which overwrites the existing
        <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">head</tt> command because the file system is case-insensitive.
        <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">head</tt> is a standard command used in many shell scripts and
        Makefiles. You need to get the original <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">head</tt> executable
        back if you want to use Fink.</p><p>The bootstrap script of the source release now checks for this, but
        you can still run into it if you use the binary release for first-time
        installation or install libwww after you installed Fink.</p><p>This problem has also been reported due to the installation of
        <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">/sw/bin/HEAD</tt> (not by any Fink package). This is
        easier to solve: rename <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">/sw/bin/HEAD</tt>.</p></div>

        nominally the same):</p><pre>sudo dpkg -i --force-overwrite <b>filename</b>

      <div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> If you have StuffIt Pro installed, it could be that you have
        "Archive Via Real Name" mode enabled. Check for a StuffIt preference
        pane in the System Preferences tool, and disable "ArchiveViaRealName"
        if it's enabled. It contains a buggy reimplementation of a few
        important system calls that will cause a number of strange and
        transient errors such as this.</p><p>Otherwise, an  <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">mv</tt> error typically means that
        another error happened earlier in the build, but the build process
        didn't stop. To track down the offending file(s), search in the output

      <div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> This is a frequent source of problems, because the package
        configuration script finds headers and libraries in 
        <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">/usr/local</tt> and decides to use them rather than using those in the Fink tree.
        Often, such errors will show up as part of a package's build diagnostics, for example:</p><pre>

	 ./objs/.libs/ftgzip.d uses /usr/local/include/zconf.h
	 ./objs/.libs/ftgzip.d uses /usr/local/include/zlib.h
Please fix build process to get consistent use of fink's headers.
        </pre><p>And if you are having problems with a build that aren't covered by another
        FAQ entry, you should also check whether you have libraries in
        <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">/usr/local/lib</tt> or headers in <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">/usr/local/include</tt>.</p><p>If you do have headers and/or libraries in <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">/usr/local</tt>, then rename
        <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">/usr/local</tt> to something else, e.g.:</p><pre>sudo mv /usr/local /usr/local.moved</pre><p>do your build, and then you can put <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">/usr/local</tt>
        back:</p><pre>sudo mv /usr/local.moved /usr/local</pre><p>Starting with macOS 10.14, it's sometimes not possible to rename <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">/usr/local</tt>. If you get an error when renaming <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">/usr/local</tt> directly, then rename the subdirectories inside it instead:</p><pre>

        names like "mysql", "pgsql", and "games". Where did they come
        from?</b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> You have used Fink to install a package which is dependent on
        another package, passwd. passwd installs a number of extra users on
        your system for security reasons -- on Unix systems, files and
        processes belong to "owners", which allows system administrators to
        fine-tune the permissions and security of the system. Programs such as
        Apache and MySQL need an "owner", and it is insecure to assign these
        daemons to root (imagine what would happen if Apache were to be
        compromised and suddenly had write permission to all files on the
        system). Thus, the passwd package takes the work out of setting up
        these extra users for Fink packages that require this.</p><p>It can be alarming to discover suddenly a number of unexpected
        users in your "System Preferences: Users" pane (on 10.2.x) or "System Preferences: Accounts" pane (on 10.3.x), but suppress the urge 
        to delete them:</p><ul>
          <li>First of all, you have obviously chosen to install a package
          which requires their use, so deleting the user doesn't make much
          sense, does it?</li>
          <li>There are in fact a number of extra users already installed on
          Mac OS X that you may not have known about: www, daemon, nobody, are
          just a few of them. The presence of these extra users is a standard
          Unix convention for running certain services; the passwd package
          simply adds a couple of extra that Apple did not provide. You can
          see these Apple-installed users in NetInfo Manager.app, or by
          running <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">niutil -list . /users</tt>
          </li>
          <li>If you do decide to delete these users, be very careful of how
          you go about it. Using the "System Preferences: Users" pane (on 10.2.x) or "System Preferences: Accounts" pane (on 10.3.x) will assign all of their files to a random administrator account, and
          there have been reports of havoc played with the administrator
          account's permissions. This is a bug with System Preferences, and
          has been submitted to Apple. A safer way to remove these users from
          your system is to do so from within NetInfo Manager.app or use the
          command line tool <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">niutil</tt> in Terminal. Read the man page
          for <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">niutil</tt> for more information about NetInfo.</li>
        </ul><p>Fink <b>does</b> request permission to install these additional
        users on your system during the installation of the passwd package, so
        this should not have come as a surprise.</p></div>

      <div class="question"><p><b>Q8.3: How do I compile something myself using Fink-installed
        software?</b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> When compiling something yourself outside of Fink, the compiler and
        linker need to be told where to find the Fink-installed libraries and
		headers.  It is also necessary to tell the compiler to use the
		appropriate target architecture.  For a package that uses standard
		configure/make process, you need to set some environment variables:</p><p>-bash-</p><pre>export CFLAGS=-I/sw/include 
export LDFLAGS=-L/sw/lib 
export CXXFLAGS=$CFLAGS 
export CPPFLAGS=$CXXFLAGS 
export ACLOCAL_FLAGS="-I /sw/share/aclocal"
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/sw/lib/pkgconfig"
export PATH=/sw/var/lib/fink/path-prefix-clang:$PATH
export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.9</pre><p>-tcsh-</p><pre>setenv CFLAGS -I/sw/include 
setenv LDFLAGS -L/sw/lib 
setenv CXXFLAGS $CFLAGS 
setenv CPPFLAGS $CXXFLAGS 
setenv ACLOCAL_FLAGS "-I /sw/share/aclocal"
setenv PKG_CONFIG_PATH "/sw/lib/pkgconfig"
setenv PATH /sw/var/lib/fink/path-prefix-clang:$PATH
setenv MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET 10.9</pre><p>(assuming that the build system is running OS 10.9 or later)</p><p>It is often easiest just to add these to your startup files (e.g.
        <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">.cshrc</tt> | <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">.profile</tt>) so they
        are set automatically. If a package does not use these variables, you
        may need to add the "-I/sw/include" (for headers) and "-L/sw/lib" (for
        libraries) to the compile lines yourself. Some packages may use
        similar non-standard variables such as EXTRA_CFLAGS or --with-qt-dir=
        configure options. "./configure --help" will usually give you a list
        of the extra configure options.</p><p>In addition, you may need to install the development headers (e.g.
        <b>foo-1.0-1-dev</b>) for the library packages that you are using,

	  Packages with names like <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">system-perl</tt> are
	  placeholder packages. These do not contain actual files, but
	  merely serve as a mechanism for fink to know about programs
	  that have been installed manually outside of fink.
	</p><p>
	  Starting with the 10.3 distribution, most placeholders
	  aren't even real packages that you can install and remove.
	  Instead, they are "Virtual Packages", package data
	  structures generated by the fink program itself in response
	  to a preconfigured list of manually installed programs. For
	  each virtual package, fink checks for certain files in
	  certain locations, and if they are found, considers that
	  virtual package "installed".
	</p><p>
	  You can run the program <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">fink-virtual-pkgs</tt>
	  (part of the fink package) to get a listing of exactly what
	  fink thinks is installed. Adding the <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">--debug</tt>
	  flag will give lots of diagnostic information about exactly
	  what files fink is checking.
	</p><p>
	  Unfortunately, there is no mechanism by which you can
	  install an arbitrary program yourself (outside of fink) and
	  have fink recognize that program rather than trying to
	  install its own version of it. It's just too difficult in
	  the general case to be able to check configure and compiler
	  flags, pathnames, etc.
	</p><p>
	  Here are the most important virtual packages that fink
	  defines (as of fink-0.19.2):
	</p><ul>
          <li>system-perl: [virtual package representing perl]
	    <p>
	      Represents <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">/usr/bin/perl</tt>, which is
	      part of the default OS X installation. This package also
	      provides <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">system-perlXXX</tt> and
	      <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">perlXXX-core</tt> according to the version X.X.X
	      of that perl interpreter.
	    </p>
          </li>
          <li>system-javaXXX: [virtual package representing Java X.X.X]
	    <p>
	      Represents the Java Runtime Environment, which is part of OS
	      X (and Apple's Software Update). See
	      <a href="http://www.apple.com/java">Apple's Java
	      page</a> for more information.
	    </p>
          </li>
          <li>system-javaXXX-dev: [virtual package representing Java X.X.X development headers]
	    <p>
	      Represents the Java SDK, which must be manually
	      downloaded from <a href="http://connect.apple.com">connect.apple.com</a>
	      (free registration required) and installed. If you have
	      updated your Java Runtime Environment, your SDK may not
	      be updated automatically (and may even be deleted!).
	      Remember to check for (and download and install if
	      necessary) the SDK after installing or upgrading your
	      Runtime Environment. See also <a href="#comp-general.system-java">this FAQ
	      entry</a>.
	    </p>
          </li>
          <li>system-java3d: [virtual package representing Java3D]</li>
          <li>system-javaai: [virtual package representing Java Advanced Imaging]
	    <p>
	      Represent Java extensions for 3D graphics and image
	      processing, which must be manually downloaded from Apple
	      and installed. See <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=120289">Apple'
	      webpage</a> for more information.
	    </p>
          </li>
          <li>system-xfree86: [placeholder for user installed x11]</li>
          <li>system-xfree86-shlibs: [placeholder for user installed x11 shared libraries]
	    <p>
	      Represent Apple's X11/XDarwin, an optional part of OS X
	      (X11User.pkg). These packages provide <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">x11</tt>
	      and <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">x11-shlibs</tt>, respectively. See
	      also <a href="#comp-packages.cant-install-xfree">this FAQ entry</a>.
	    </p>
          </li>
          <li>system-xfree86-dev [placeholder for user installed x11 development tools]
	    <p>
	      Represents Apple's X11/XDarwin SDK, an optional part of
	      OS X (X11SDK.pkg). This package provides
	      <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">x11-dev</tt>. See also <a href="#comp-packages.cant-install-xfree">this FAQ entry</a>.

      <div class="question"><p><b>Q9.1: I get no sound from XMMS</b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> Make sure you have the "eSound Output Plugin" selected in the XMMS
        preferences. For some strange reason, it selects the disk writer
        plugin as the default.</p><p>If you still get no sound output or XMMS complains that it can't
        find your sound card try this:</p><ul>
          <li>Make sure you haven't muted sound output in Mac OS X.</li>
          <li>Run <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">esdcat /usr/libexec/config.guess</tt> (or any other
          file of a decent size). If you hear a short noise, eSound works and
          XMMS should work too if it's configured correctly. If you don't hear
          anything, esd isn't working for some reason. You can try to start it
          up manually with <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">esd &amp;</tt> and watch the messages.</li>
          <li>If it still doesn't work, check the permissions on
          <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">/tmp/.esd</tt> and <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">/tmp/.esd/socket</tt>. Those
          should have your normal user account as the owner. If they aren't
          owned by you, kill esd if it's running, remove the directory as root
          (<tt style="white-space: nowrap;">sudo rm -rf /tmp/.esd</tt>), then start esd again (as a
          normal user, not as root).</li>
        </ul><p>Note that esd is designed to be run by a normal user, not by root.
        It usually communicates via the file system socket
        <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">/tmp/.esd/socket</tt>. You only need the <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">-tcp</tt> and
        <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">-port</tt> switches if you want to run esd clients on another
        machine over the network.</p><p>There have also been reports of XMMS crashing or freezing on 10.1.
        We don't have an analysis or a fix yet.</p></div>

          <li>
            <b>You are installing from binaries:</b>
            <p>Typically what you need to do is reinstall the X11User package,

          <li>
            <b>You are installing from source:</b>
	    <p>Typically this error means that you need to (re)install the X11SDK,

            It is in the Xcode Tools folder of a Tiger DVD, or (Optional

	    reinstall the X11SDK, since sometimes the Apple Installer misses a
