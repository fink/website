      <div class="question"><p><b><?php echo FINK_Q ; ?>6.1: A configure script complains that it can't find an "acceptable cc".
        What's that?</b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b><?php echo FINK_A ; ?>:</b> Read the docs next time. To compile packages from source, you must
        install the Developer Tools, which among other stuff contains the C
        compiler, <code>cc</code>.</p></div>

      <div class="question"><p><b><?php echo FINK_Q ; ?>6.2: When I try a "fink selfupdate-cvs" I get this message: "cvs:
        Command not found."</b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b><?php echo FINK_A ; ?>:</b> You need to install the Developer Tools.</p></div>

        </b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b><?php echo FINK_A ; ?>:</b> if your message is of the form</p><pre>make: command not found</pre><p>or</p><pre>Can't exec "make": 
No such file or directory at /sw/lib/perl5/Fink/Services.pm line 190.</pre><p>It means you need to install the Developer Tools.</p><p>On the other hand, if your error message looks like</p><pre>make: illegal option -- C</pre><p>then you've replaced the GNU version of the <code>make</code>
        utility installed as part of the Developer Tools with a BSD version of
        make. Many packages rely on special features only supported by GNU
        make. Make sure that <code>/usr/bin/make</code> is a symlink to
        <code>gnumake</code>, not <code>bsdmake</code>. Furthermore, make sure
        that <code>/usr/local/bin/</code> does not contain another copy of
        <code>make</code>.</p></div>
    </a>
    <a name="head">
      <div class="question"><p><b><?php echo FINK_Q ; ?>6.4: I'm getting a strange usage message from the head command. What's
        broken?</b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b><?php echo FINK_A ; ?>:</b> If you're seeing this:</p><pre>Unknown option: 1 Usage: head [-options] &lt;url&gt;...</pre><p>followed by a list of option descriptions, you have a broken
        <code>head</code> executable. This happens when you install the Perl
        libwww library on an HFS+ system volume. It tries to create a new
        command <code>/usr/bin/HEAD</code>, which overwrites the existing
        <code>head</code> command because the file system is case-insensitive.
        <code>head</code> is a standard command used in many shell scripts and
        Makefiles. You need to get the original <code>head</code> executable
        back if you want to use Fink.</p><p>The bootstrap script of the source release now checks for this, but
        you can still run into it if you use the binary release for first-time
        installation or install libwww after you installed Fink.</p><p>This problem has also been reported due to the installation of
        <code>/sw/bin/HEAD</code> (not by any Fink package). This is
        easier to solve: rename <code>/sw/bin/HEAD</code>.</p></div>
    </a>
    <a name="also_in">
      <div class="question"><p><b><?php echo FINK_Q ; ?>6.5: When I try to install a package I get an error message about trying
        to overwrite a file that is in another package.</b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b><?php echo FINK_A ; ?>:</b> This occasionally happens with splitoff packages (i.e. the ones
        with -dev, -shlibs, etc.) when a file gets moved from one part of the
        splitoff to another (e.g. from <code>foo</code> to
        <code>foo-shlibs</code>. What you can do is overwrite the file with
        that from the package you are trying to install (since they are
        nominally the same):</p><pre>sudo dpkg -i --force-overwrite <b>filename</b>
        </pre><p>where <b>filename</b> is the .deb file corresponding to the
        package that you are trying to install.</p></div>
    </a>
    <a name="mv-failed">
      <div class="question"><p><b><?php echo FINK_Q ; ?>6.6: What does "execution of mv failed, exit code 1" mean when I try to
        build a package?</b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b><?php echo FINK_A ; ?>:</b> If you have StuffIt Pro installed, it could be that you have
        "Archive Via Real Name" mode enabled. Check for a StuffIt preference
        pane in the System Preferences tool, and disable "ArchiveViaRealName"
        if it's enabled. It contains a buggy reimplementation of a few
        important system calls that will cause a number of strange and
        transient errors such as this.</p><p>Otherwise, an  <code>mv</code> error typically means that
        another error happened earlier in the build, but the build process
        didn't stop. To track down the offending file(s), search in the output
        of the build for the nonexistent file, e.g. if you have something
        like:</p><pre>mv /sw/src/root-foo-0.1.2-3/sw/lib/libbar*.dylib \
/sw/src/root-foo-shlibs-0.1.2-3/sw/lib/ 
mv: cannot stat `/sw/src/root-foo-0.1.2-3/sw/lib/libbar*.dylib': 
No such file or directory 
### execution of mv failed, exit code 1 
Failed: installing foo-0.1.2-3 failed</pre><p>then you should look for <code>libbar</code> somewhere
        further back in the output of your build attempt.</p></div>
    </a>
    <a name="node-exists">
      <div class="question"><p><b><?php echo FINK_Q ; ?>6.7: I can't install a package | update because I get a message that a
        "node" already exists.</b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b><?php echo FINK_A ; ?>:</b> These errors look something like this:</p><pre>Failed: Internal error: node for system-xfree86 already exists</pre><p>This problem is that the dependency engine is confused, due to
        changes in some of the package info files. To fix it:</p><ul>
          <li>
            <p>Remove the offending package by force, e. g.</p>
            <pre>sudo dpkg -r --force-all system-xfree86</pre>
            <p>for the example given above.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Try again to install | upgrade. At some point a "virtual
          dependency" prompt will come up that includes the package you just
          removed. Select it, and it will be reinstalled during your
          build.</p>
          </li>
        </ul></div>
    </a>
    <a name="usr-local-libs">
      <div class="question"><p><b><?php echo FINK_Q ; ?>6.8: I've heard that libraries and headers installed under /usr/local sometimes
        cause build problems for Fink. Is this true?</b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b><?php echo FINK_A ; ?>:</b> This is a frequent source of problems, because the package
        configuration script finds headers and libraries in 
        <code>/usr/local</code> and decides to use them rather than using those in the Fink tree.
        Often, such errors will show up as part of a package's build diagnostics, for example:</p><pre>
Looking for incorrect headers in 44 dependency files...
	 ./objs/.libs/ftgzip.d uses /usr/local/include/zconf.h
	 ./objs/.libs/ftgzip.d uses /usr/local/include/zlib.h
Please fix build process to get consistent use of fink's headers.
        </pre><p>And if you are having problems with a build that aren't covered by another
        FAQ entry, you should also check whether you have libraries in
        <code>/usr/local/lib</code> or headers in <code>/usr/local/include</code>.</p><p>If you do have headers and/or libraries in <code>/usr/local</code>, then rename
        <code>/usr/local</code> to something else, e.g.:</p><pre>sudo mv /usr/local /usr/local.moved</pre><p>do your build, and then you can put <code>/usr/local</code>
        back:</p><pre>sudo mv /usr/local.moved /usr/local</pre><p>Starting with macOS 10.14, it's sometimes not possible to rename <code>/usr/local</code>. If you get an error when renaming <code>/usr/local</code> directly, then rename the subdirectories inside it instead:</p><pre>
        sudo mv /usr/local/include /usr/local/include.moved
        sudo mv /usr/local/lib /usr/local/lib.moved
        </pre><p>do your build, and then you can put <code>/usr/local/include</code> and <code>/usr/local/lib</code>
        back:</p><pre>
        sudo mv /usr/local/include.moved /usr/local/include
        sudo mv /usr/local/lib.moved /usr/local/lib
        </pre></div>
    </a>
    <a name="toc-out-of-date">
      <div class="question"><p><b><?php echo FINK_Q ; ?>6.9: When I try to build a package, I get a message that a "table of
        contents" is out of date. What do I need to do?</b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b><?php echo FINK_A ; ?>:</b> The output hints at what to do. The message is usually something
        like:</p><pre>ld: table of contents for archive: 
/sw/lib/libintl.a is out of date; 
rerun ranlib(1) (can't load from it)</pre><p>What you need to do is run ranlib (as root) on whatever library is
        causing the problem. As an example, for the case above, you would
        run:</p><pre>sudo ranlib /sw/lib/libintl.a</pre></div>
    </a>
    <a name="fc-atlas">
      <div class="question"><p><b><?php echo FINK_Q ; ?>6.10: Fink Commander hangs when I try to install atlas.</b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b><?php echo FINK_A ; ?>:</b> This happens because one of the steps in the build of
        <code>atlas</code> sends a prompt to the user that Fink Commander
        doesn't display. You'll have to use <code>fink install atlas</code>
        instead.</p></div>
    </a>
    <a name="basic-headers">
      <div class="question"><p><b><?php echo FINK_Q ; ?>6.11: I get messages saying that I'm missing <code>stddef.h</code> | <code>wchar.h</code> | <code>stdlib.h</code> | <code>crt1.o</code>, or that my <q>C compiler cannot create executables</q>.</b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b><?php echo FINK_A ; ?>:</b> Both of these problems are typically due to the absence of essential headers that are provided by the DevSDK package of
        the Developer Tools. Check whether
        <code>/Library/Receipts/DevSDK.pkg</code> exists on your
        system. If not, then run the Dev Tools Installer again, and install
        the DevSDK package using a Custom Install.</p><p>The <q>cannot create executables</q> error can also occur when your Developer Tools version is for an earlier OS version.</p></div>
    </a>
    <a name="multiple-dependencies">
      <div class="question"><p><b><?php echo FINK_Q ; ?>6.12: I can't update, because Fink is "unable to resolve version conflict
        on multiple dependencies".</b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b><?php echo FINK_A ; ?>:</b> To get around this, try updating a single package, then try to use
        "fink update-all" again. If you still get the message, repeat the
        process.</p></div>
    </a>
    <a name="dpkg-parse-error">
      <div class="question"><p><b><?php echo FINK_Q ; ?>6.13: I can't install anything because I get "dpkg: parse error, in file
        `/sw/var/lib/dpkg/status'"!</b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b><?php echo FINK_A ; ?>:</b> This means that somehow your dpkg database got damaged, usually
        from a crash or some other unrecoverable error.  This most often occurs with a buildlock, e.g:</p><pre>package `fink-buildlock-foo-1.2.3-4':  missing version</pre><p>(of course, replace <code>foo-1.2.3-4</code> with the package name you are seeing).</p><p>When this happens, you should edit <code>/sw/var/lib/dpkg/status</code> as a superuser.
	Then go near the line number which shows up in the error message.
	You should see a <code>fink-buildlock-foo-1.2.3-4</code>
        package whose <code>Status</code> field is marked</p><pre>install ok installed</pre><p>Change that to</p><pre>purge ok not-installed</pre><p>Under other circumstances, there may be garbage in the file.  You can fix this situation by
        copying the previous version of the database, like so:</p><pre>sudo cp /sw/var/lib/dpkg/status-old /sw/var/lib/dpkg/status</pre><p>You may need to re-install the last couple of packages you
        installed before the problem started occurring.</p></div>

    <a name="freetype-problems">
      <div class="question"><p><b><?php echo FINK_Q ; ?>6.14: I get errors involving freetype.</b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b><?php echo FINK_A ; ?>:</b> There are several varieties of such errors.  If you get the following:</p><pre>/usr/bin/ld: can't locate file for: -lfreetype</pre><p>check whether you have an extraneous <code>freetype-config</code> excutable by running</p><pre>where freetype-config</pre><p>if you're using <code>tcsh</code>, or</p><pre>type -a freetype-config</pre><p>if you're using <code>bash</code>.

For example, if you're on Panther you should have <code>xml-parser-pm581</code> rather than <code>xml-parser-pm560</code> (you may also have the <code>xml-parser-pm</code> placeholder), since you have <code>Perl-5.8.1</code> rather than <code>Perl-5.6.0</code>.  If you're on Jaguar, and are using the default system Perl version, you'll have the <code>pm560</code> variant, and if you've installed <code>Perl 5.8.0</code> you may have the <code>pm580</code> variant.</p></div>

Typically these errors occur when a new upstream version of a package is released, but hasn't made it to the Master mirrors yet.</p><p>To remedy this, run <code>fink configure</code> and set the search order to use Master mirrors last.</p></div>

      <div class="question"><p><b><?php echo FINK_Q ; ?>6.21: I want Fink to use different options in building a package.</b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b><?php echo FINK_A ; ?>:</b> The first thing to do is to contact the package maintainer to request a variant.  It may be relatively easy to do it.  If you don't hear from the maintainer or see the new packages, or want to try a different option yourself, check out the <a href="/doc/quick-start-pkg/index.php">Packaging Tutorial</a> and <a href="/doc/packaging/index.php">Packaging Manual</a>.</p><p>
          <b>Note:  </b>Fink is deliberately set up such that all official binaries are identical regardless of what machine they are built on, so things like G5 optimization won't happen with an official package.  If you want them, you'll have to do it yourself.</p></div>

      <div class="question"><p><b><?php echo FINK_Q ; ?>6.22: Whenever I try to build from source, Fink keeps waffling between alternate versions of the same library.</b></p></div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b><?php echo FINK_A ; ?>:</b> Often, in a complicated build tree, you may find that some of the packages
	depend on a particular version of a library, and other depend on a different one
	(e.g. <code>db47</code> vs. <code>db44</code>).  Consequently, Fink may try to
	switch to whichever one isn't currently installed in order to satisfy the
	build dependency for the current package that you're trying to update.</p><p>Unfortunately, due to limitations in the build-dependency engine, you
      may wind up with the dreaded</p><pre>Fink::SysState: Could not resolve inconsistent dependencies</pre><p>message when trying a sufficiently complicated <code>update-all</code>. This generally gives you a
      command to try to resolve the issue:</p><pre>
fink scanpackages
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install foo=1.23-4	
      </pre><p>but this may not work for sufficiently complicated updates.  You might need
      to update packages one-by-one, at least for a while.

### execution of /sw/bin/python2.4 failed, exit code 1</pre><p>the problem occurs because the <code>python2*</code> packages write the current <code>MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET</code> to a configuration file when they're built and the python build utilities use this value when compiling modules. This means that if you have, for example, a <code>python24</code> package on 10.4 that was built on 10.3, either by upgrading 10.3 =&gt; 10.4, or via the <b>10.4-transitional</b> binary distribution, in which <code>python24</code> wasn't rebuilt, there will be a mismatch between what python thinks <code>MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET</code> should be (10.3) and what it actually is (10.4).</p><p>The fix is to rebuild the offending <code>python</code> package, e.g. <code>fink rebuild python24</code> for the case above.</p><p>For runtime errors that give the same type of error message as above, rebuild the module after rebuilding the appropriate <code>python2*</code> package.</p></div>

<div class="answer"><p><b><?php echo FINK_A ; ?>:</b> This error:</p><pre> libtool: unrecognized option `-dynamic'</pre><p>typically means that you've replaced Apple's <code>/usr/bin/libtool</code> with a GNU <code>libtool</code>.

It is installed as part of the <code>DeveloperTools.pkg</code> package of the XCode Tools, and you can reinstall that whole package if you first clear out its receipt in <code>/Library/Receipts</code> (drag it to the Trash for OS 10.4 and later, or use <code>sudo rm -rf /Library/Receipts/DeveloperTools.pkg</code> for 10.3).</p></div>
