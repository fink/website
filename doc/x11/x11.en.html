    <h3><a name="intro.def-x11">1.1 What is X11?</a></h3>
      
      <p>
The <a href="http://www.x.org/">X Window System</a> Version 11,
or X11 for short, is a graphics display system with a
network-transparent client-server architecture.
It allows applications to draw pixels, lines, text, images, etc. on
your screen.
X11 also comes with additional libraries that let applications easily
draw user interfaces, i.e. buttons, text fields, and so on.
</p>
      <p>
X11 is the de facto standard graphics system in the Unix world.
It comes with Linux, the *BSDs and most commercial Unix flavors.
Desktop environments like CDE, KDE and GNOME run on top of it.
</p>
    
    <h3><a name="intro.def-macosx">1.2 What is Mac OS X?</a></h3>
      
      <p>
        <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Mac OS X</a> is an
operating system produced by <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a>.
Like its predecessors NeXTStep and OpenStep, it is based on BSD and is
thus a member of the Unix OS family.
However, it comes with a proprietary graphics display system.
The graphics engine is called Quartz and the look and feel is called
Aqua, although the two names are often used intercheangably.
</p>
    
    <h3><a name="intro.def-darwin">1.3 What is Darwin?</a></h3>
      
      <p>
        <a href="http://opendarwin.org/">Darwin</a> is
basically a stripped-down version of Mac OS X that is available free
of charge and with full source code.
It does not contain Quartz, Aqua, or any other related technology.
By default, it only offers a text console.
</p>
    
    <h3><a name="intro.def-xfree86">1.4 What is XFree86?</a></h3>
      
      <p>
        <a href="http://www.xfree86.org/">XFree86</a> is an open source
implementation of X11.
It was initially developed to run on Intel x86 PCs, hence the name.
Nowadays, it runs on many architectures and operating systems,
including OS/2, Darwin, Mac OS X and Windows.
      </p>
       <p>
Apple's X11 distributions on OS 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4 are derived from XFree86.
      </p>

<h3><a name="intro.def-xorg">1.5 What is X.org?</a></h3>
  
  <p>
<a href="http://www.x.org/wiki/">X.org</a> is an open source implementation
of X11, and a successor to XFree86.  It has supplanted XFree86 in most places.
  </p>
  <p>
Apple's X11 distributions on OS 10.5 and 10.6 are derived from X.org, as is
 <a href="http://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/wiki">XQuartz</a>.
Apple's X11 distribution on 10.7 is derived, in turn, from XQuartz.</p>

<h3><a name="intro.def-xquartx">1.6 What is XQuartz?</a></h3>
  
  <p>
<a href="http://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/wiki">
XQuartz</a> is an X11 distribution for OS 10.5 and later which contains newer features
than does the stock X11 on 10.5-10.7.  On 10.5, XQuartz replaces the system's X11 distribution,
whereas on 10.6 and 10.7 Xquartz and the system's X11 distribution coexist by installing
in different base paths.  On 10.8 Xquartz <b>is</b> the standard X11 distribution.
  </p>

     <h3><a name="intro.client-server">1.7 Client and Server</a></h3>
      
      <p>
X11 has a client-server architecture.
There is one central program that does the actual drawing and
coordinates access by several applications; that is the server.
An application that wants to draw using X11 connects to the server and
tells it what to draw.
Thus applications are called clients in the X11 world.
</p>
      <p>
X11 allows the server and the clients to be on different machines,
which often results in confusion over the terms.
In an environment with workstations and servers, you will run the X11
display server on the workstation machine and the applications (the X
clients) on the server machine.
So when talking about the "server", that means the X11 display server
program, not the machine hidden in your wardrobe.
</p>
    
    <h3><a name="intro.rootless">1.8 What does rootless mean?</a></h3>
      
      <p>
A little background:
X11 models the screen as a hierarchy of windows contained in each
other.
At the top of the hierarchy is a special window which is the size of
the screen and contains all other windows.
This window contains the desktop background and is called the "root
window".
</p>
      <p>
Now back on topic:
Like any graphical environment, X11 was written to stand alone and
have full control over the screen.
In Mac OS X, Quartz already governs the screen, so one must make
arrangements if both are to get along together.
</p>
      <p>
One arrangement is to let the two take turns.
Each environment gets a complete screen, but only one of them is
visible at a time and the user can switch between them.
This is called full-screen or rooted mode.
It is called rooted because there is a perfectly normal root window on
the X11 screen that works like on other systems.
</p>
      <p>
Another arrangement is to mix the two environments window by window.
This eliminates the need to switch between two screens.
It also eliminates the X11 root window, because Quartz already takes
care of the desktop background.
Because there is no (visible) root window, this mode is called
"rootless".  It is the most comfortable way to use X11 on Mac OS X.
</p>
    
    <h3><a name="intro.wm">1.9 What is a window manager?</a></h3>
      
      <p>
In most graphical environments the look of window frames (title bar,
close button, etc.) is defined by the system.
X11 is different.
With X11, the window frames (also called "decoration") are provided by
a separate program, called the window manager.
In most respects, the window manager is just another client
application; it is started the same way and talks to the X server
through the same channels.
</p>
      <p>
There is a large number of different window managers to choose from.
<a href="http://www.xwinman.org/">xwinman.org</a> has a
comprehensive list.
Most popular ones allow the user to customize the appearance via
so-called <a href="http://www.themes.org/">themes</a>.
Many window managers also provide additional functionality, like pop
up menus in the root window, docks or launch buttons.
</p>
      <p>
Many window managers have been packaged for Fink; here is a
<a href="http://pdb.finkproject.org/pdb/browse.php?sec=x11-wm">    
current list.
</a>
      </p>
    
    <h3><a name="intro.desktop">1.10 What are Quartz/Aqua, Gnome, and KDE?</a></h3>
      
      <p>
They are desktop environments, and there are many others.  Their purpose 
is to provide additional framework to applications, so that their look, 
feel, and behaviour can be visually consistent.  Example: 
</p>
      <p> graphics engine : X11
</p>
      <p> window manager:
<a href="http://sawmill.sourceforge.net/">sawfish</a>
      </p>
      <p> desktop: <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">Gnome</a>
      </p>
      <p>
The lines between graphics display engine, window manager,
and desktop are blurred because similar, or the same functionality, 
may be implemented by one or more of them. This is one reason why a
particular window manager may not be able to be used with a
particular desktop environment.

</p>
      <p>
Many applications are developed to integrate with a particular desktop.  
Most often by installing the libraries for the desktop environment 
(and the other underlying libraries) that an application was developed 
for, the application will work with limited or no function loss.  
Examples are the increasing 
<a href="http://pdb.finkproject.org/pdb/section.php/gnome">
selection of GNOME applications 
</a>
available to be installed and run without running GNOME.  
Unfortunately, the same 
<a href="/faq/usage-fink.php#kde">
progress is not quite yet able to be made
</a>
with <a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE applications.</a>
      </p>
    
  <h2><a name="history">2 History</a></h2>
    
    
    
      <p>[Sorry for the epic language, I couldn't resist...]</p>
    
    <h3><a name="history.early">2.1 The early days</a></h3>
      
      <p>
In the beginning, there was void.
Darwin was in its infancy, Mac OS X was still in development and there
was no X11 implementation for both of them.
</p>
      <p>
Then there came John Carmack and ported XFree86 to Mac OS X Server,
which was the only OS in the Darwin family available at that time.
Later that port was updated for XFree86 4.0 and Darwin 1.0 by Dave
Zarzycki.
The patches found their way into the Darwin CVS repository and slept
there, waiting for things to come.
</p>
    
    <h3><a name="history.xonx-forms">2.2 XonX forms</a></h3>
      
      <p>
One fine day Torrey T. Lyons came along and gave the Darwin patches
the attention they had been waiting for.
Finally, he brought them to a new home, the official XFree86 CVS
repository.
This was the time of the Mac OS X Public Beta and Darwin 1.2.
XFree86 4.0.2 worked fine on Darwin, but on Mac OS X it required users
to log out of Aqua and go to the console to run it.
So Torrey gathered the <a href="http://mrcla.com/XonX/">XonX team</a> around
him and set out on a voyage to bring XFree86 to Mac OS X.
</p>
      <p>
At about the same time Tenon started to build Xtools, using XFree86
4.0 as the foundation.
</p>
    
    <h3><a name="history.root-or-not">2.3 To root or not to root</a></h3>
      
      <p>
Soon the XonX team had XFree86 running in a fullscreen mode in
parallel to Quartz and was putting out test releases for adventurous
users.
The test releases were called XFree86-Aqua, or XAqua for short.
Since Torrey had taken the lead, changes went directly to
XFree86's CVS repository, which was heading towards the 4.1.0
release.
</p>
      <p>
In the first stages interfacing with Quartz was done via a small
application called Xmaster.app (written with Carbon, then rewritten
with Cocoa).
Later that code was integrated into the X server proper, giving birth
to XDarwin.app.
Shared library support was also added at this time (and Tenon was
convinced to use this set of patches instead of their own to ensure
binary compatibility).
There was even good progress on a rootless mode (using the Carbon
API), but alas, it was too late to get it into XFree86 4.1.0.
And the rootless patch was free, and continued to float around the
net.
After XFree86 4.1.0 shipped with just the fullscreen mode, work on the
rootless mode continued, now using the Cocoa API.
An experimental rootless mode was put into XFree86's CVS repository.
</p>
      <p>
In the meantime, Apple released Mac OS X 10.0 and Darwin 1.3,
and Tenon released Xtools 1.0 some weeks after that.
</p>
      <p>Development continued on integrating the rootless mode into XFree86,
so that by the time XFree86 4.2.0 shipped in January 2002, the Darwin/Mac OS X 
version had been completely integrated into the main XFree86 distribution.
</p>
    
    <h3><a name="history.apple-x11-distros">2.4 Apple's X11 distributions</a></h3>
         
      <p>
        On January 7, 2003, Apple released a beta version of its own custom X11
        implementation for OS 10.2.
        It was based on XFree86-4.2 and included Quartz rendering and accelerated
        OpenGL.
        A new version was released on February 10, 2003 with additional features
        and bugfixes.
        A third release (i.e. Beta 3) was made on March 17, 2003 with
        further additional features and bugfixes.
      </p>
      <p>
        On October 24, 2003, Apple released Panther (10.3), which included the first
        release version of their X11 distribution, based on XFree86-4.3.
      </p>
      <p>
        On April 29, 2005, Apple released Tiger (10.4), which included an X11 distribution based on XFree86-4.4.
      </p>
      <p>
        On October 26, 2007, Apple released Leopard (10.5), which included an X11 distribution based on X.org-7.2.  
      </p>  
      <p>
        On August 28, 2009, Apple released Snow Leopard (10.6), which included an X11 distribution based on X.org-7.2.  
      </p>
      <p>On July 20, 2011, Apple released Lion (10.7), which included an X11 distribution based on XQuartz-2.6.4.</p>
      <p>
        On July 25, 2012, Apple relased Mountain Lion (10.8).  For this version of OS X, XQuartz-2.7.2 or later is the
        appropriate X11 distribution to use.
      </p>
    
  <h2><a name="inst-xfree86">3 Getting and Installing X11</a></h2>
    
    
    <h3><a name="inst-xfree86.apple-binary">3.1 Apple's Distributions</a></h3>
      
      <p>
        All of the OS X versions currently supported by Fink use an X11 distribution from Apple.
        The supported configurations are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>10.5:</b>  Fink supports the built-in X11 as well as XQuartz-2.6.3 and earlier.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Note:</b>  Apple's X11 on 10.6 has older-versioned libraries than does XQuartz-2.4, so
            installing such a version of XQuartz complicates upgrades from 10.5 to 10.6.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>10.6:</b>  Fink only supports the built-in X11.  Since our packages are only
            supposed to build the built-in X11, if you really want to use XQuartz and Fink you will
            need to make sure to keep the stock X11 installed, too.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>10.7:</b>  Fink only supports the built-in X11.  Since our packages are only
            supposed to build the built-in X11, if you really want to use XQuartz and Fink you will
            need to make sure to keep the stock X11 installed, too.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>10.8:</b>  Fink only supports XQuartz-2.7.2 and later.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To build packages, if you're using the stock X11 on 10.5-10.7, for Xcode &lt;= 4.2.1
        you will also need to make sure that the X11 SDK is installed (though this is normally 
        the case by default).  XQuartz users on 10.5 should <b>not</b> do this, since
        XQuartz contains everything.  On 10.7, the Command Line Tools for Xcode &gt;= 4.3 contains
        the X11 SDK.  On 10.8, you only need to install XQuartz.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of the X11 packages support both full-screen and rootless operation, and have OpenGL support.
      </p>

    <h3><a name="inst-xfree86.fink">3.2 Using X11 via Fink</a></h3>
      
      <p>Fink keeps track of X11 via a set of virtual packages.  The most important of these are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><tt style="white-space: nowrap;">system-xfree86-shlibs</tt>, representing the shared libraries</li>
        <li><tt style="white-space: nowrap;">system-xfree86</tt>, representing the executables</li>
        <li><tt style="white-space: nowrap;">x11-shlibs</tt>, again representing the shared libraries</li>
        <li><tt style="white-space: nowrap;">x11</tt>, again representing the executables.</li>
        <li><tt style="white-space: nowrap;">system-xfree86-dev</tt>, representing the headers</li>
        <li><tt style="white-space: nowrap;">x11-dev</tt>, again representing the headers</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Note:  The presence of the separate <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">system-xfree86*</tt> and 
        <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">x11*</tt> families is a holdover from OS versions prior to 10.5, where Fink 
        had its own X11 packages which also provided the <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">x11</tt> family.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are missing any of these packages, then you're missing files from your X11 installation
        and may need to (re)install something.  For example, if <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">x11-dev</tt> and
        <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">system-xfree86-dev</tt> are missing, this often indicates that the X11 SDK hasn't been
        installed.
      </p>
    
  <h2><a name="run-xfree86">4 Starting X11</a></h2>
    
    
    <h3><a name="run-xfree86.display-server">4.1 Starting the Display Server</a></h3>
      
      <p>
        There are basically three ways to start X11 under Mac OS X.
      </p>
      <p>
        One is by running the application bundle, e.g. via double-clicking the app in the Finder.
        This is typically <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">/Applications/Utilities/X11(.app)</tt>, if you are on
        10.5-10.7, or <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">/Applications/Utilities/XQuartz(.app)</tt> if you're using
        Xquartz (e.g. on 10.8).
      </p>
      <p>
        Another way is via entering 
        the <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">startx</tt> command from a terminal window.
      </p>
      <p>
        The third method is to attempt to run a program that needs X11 from a terminal window.
        on 10.5 and later this will automatically start an X11 server.
      </p>
    
    <h3><a name="run-xfree86.xinitrc-d">4.2 Customizing startup using the .xinitrc.d directory</a></h3>
      
      <p>
        The preferred method in current versions of X11 to customize your startup is to create a
        directory named <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">.xinitrc.d</tt> at the top of your home directory, and to
        fill that with executable scripts to run programs that you want to use at startup, including window
        managers
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Important:</b> make sure to put an '&amp;'; after the names of programs that
        aren't window managers, or they will block other programs, including a window manager,
        from being run.  Also make sure that window managers do <b>not</b> have an
        '&amp;' after their names or they won't remain running, unless there is a session manager.
        that is set to run after them.  The <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">xinit</tt>
        program interprets such a condition that as "the session has ended, I should kill the X server
        now, too".
      </p>
      <p>
        Example:  to run the <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">WindowMaker</tt> window manager on startup, start
        with the following commands:
      </p>
      <pre>mkdir -p $HOME/.xinitrc.d
nano $HOME/.xinitrc.d/94-wmaker.sh</pre>
      <p>
        (or use your favorite editor).  Then put the following contents in
        <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">94-wmaker.sh</tt>:</p>
      <pre>. /sw/bin/init.sh
quartz-wm --only-proxy &amp;
exec wmaker
      </pre>
      <p>Save the file, then use</p>
      <pre>chmod a+x 94-wmaker.sh</pre>
      <p>to make the script executable (<tt style="white-space: nowrap;">quartz-wm --only-proxy</tt> will be discussed in a
      later section).</p>
      <p>
        Example:  to run the <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">xlogo</tt> program on startup, start
        with the following commands:
      </p>
      <pre>mkdir -p $HOME/.xinitrc.d
nano $HOME/.xinitrc.d/74-xlogo.sh</pre>
      <p>
        (again, feel free to use your favorite editor).  Then put the following contents in
        <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">74-xlogo.sh</tt>:</p>
      <pre>. /sw/bin/init.sh
xlogo &amp;</pre>
      <p>Save the file, then use</p>
      <pre>chmod a+x 74-xlogo.sh</pre>
      <p>to make the script executable.</p>
      <p>
        If you were to create both scripts above, the result would be that X11 would start up, run
        <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">xlogo</tt>, and then the <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">wmaker</tt> window manager.
      </p>
      <p>
        Example: full GNOME session.  Create an executable <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">94-gnome-session.sh</tt>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Starting each script with <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">. /sw/bin/init.sh</tt> ensures that programs which require
          other items from the Fink tree can find them.
        </li>
        <li>
          The scripts are processed in ASCII order, so use prefixes to change that, as per the '74'
          and '94' above.
        </li>
        <li>
          The scripts must be executable and have a <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">.sh</tt> extension.  Changing the
          execute permissions provides a method to alter which programs are run without deleting
          the scripts.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fink's <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">xinitrc</tt> package, which is in the dependency chain for GNOME and
          KDE, overrides some of the default X11 lookup behavior, including that for user customization.
          We recommend that you restore it as discussed in the <a href="#run-xfree86.xinitrc-pkg">Fink
          'xinitrc' package section</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
    
    <h3><a name="run-xfree86.xinitrc">4.3 The .xinitrc File</a></h3>
      
      <p>
        <b>Note:</b>  the use of scripts in <a href="#run-xfree86.xinitrc-d">$HOME/.xinitrc.d</a> is
        preferred.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a file named <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">.xinitrc</tt> exists in your home
        directory, it will be used to start some initial X clients, e.g. the
        window manager and some xterms or a desktop environment like GNOME.
        The <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">.xinitrc</tt> file is a <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">/bin/sh</tt>
        script that contains the commands to do this.  
        It is <b>not</b> necessary to put the usual <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">#!/bin/sh</tt>
        in the first line or to set the executable bit on the file;
        <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">xinit</tt> will always run it through the <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">/bin/sh</tt> shell.
      </p>
      <p>
        When there is no <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">.xinitrc</tt> file in your home
        directory, and if <a href="#run-xfree86.xinitrc-d">$HOME/.xinitrc.d</a> is not present, then
        X11 will use its default file,
        <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">/usr/X11/lib/X11/xinit/xinitrc</tt>.
        You can use the default file as a starting point for your own
        .xinitrc:
      </p>
      <pre>cp /usr/X11/lib/X11/xinit/xinitrc ~/.xinitrc</pre>
      <p>
        To ensure reliable operation of Fink programs in <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">.xinitrc</tt>, you should
        put <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">. /sw/bin/init.sh</tt> right at the beginning of the file to make sure the
        environment is set up correctly.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can put fairly arbitrary commands in an <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">.xinitrc</tt>,
        but there are some caveats.
        First, the shell that interprets the file will by default wait for
        every program to finish before it starts the next one.
        If you want several programs to run in parallel, you must tell the
        shell to put them "in the background" by adding a <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">&amp;</tt> at
        the end of the line.
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">xinit</tt> waits for the <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">.xinitrc</tt>
        script to finish and interprets that as "the session has ended, I should
        kill the X server now, too".
        This means that the last command of your <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">.xinitrc</tt>
        must not be run in the background and it should be a long-living program.
        Customarily, the window manager or session manager is used for this purpose.
        In fact, most window managers or session managers assume that <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">xinit</tt> is
        waiting for them to finish and use this to make the "Log out" entry in
        their menus work.
        (Note: To save some memory and CPU cycles, you can put an
        <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">exec</tt> before the last line like in the examples below.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Example:  turn the X11 bell off, starts some clients and finally execute the Enlightenment
        window manager:</p>
      <pre>. /sw/bin/init.sh

xset b off

xclock -geometry -0+0 &amp;
xterm &amp;

      <p>Example: start GNOME:</p>

    <h3><a name="run-xfree86.xinitrc-pkg">4.4 The 'xinitrc' package</a></h3>
      
      <p>
        Certain Fink packages need to be able to perform actions upon X11 startup.  To allow them to
        do this, there is a package called <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">xinitrc</tt> (somewhat confusing, admittedly). 
        One side effect of installing this package, which is in the dependency chains of GNOME and KDE,
        is to circumvent the <a href="#run-xfree86.xinitrc-d">default</a> behavior of using scripts from
        <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">$HOME/.xinitrc.d</tt>.  There are currently a couple of methods available to
        allow user customization of the X11 startup <b>and</b> allow Fink packages to do their
        startup tasks:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            The <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">xinitrc</tt> package provides adminstrator entry points. Create the file
            <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">/sw/etc/xinitrc-last-hook</tt> as a superuser, and
            give it the following contents:
          </p>
          <pre>#!/bin/sh
. /usr/X11/lib/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/98-user.sh</pre>
          <p>
            This will restore the <a href="#run-xfree86.xinitrc-d">default</a> behavior of looking in
            <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">$HOME/.xinitrc.d</tt> for executable scripts.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Create a <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">$HOME/.xinitrc</tt> as per the <a href="#run-xfree86.xinitrc">.xinitrc</a>
            section above.  Fink's <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">xinitrc</tt> package overwrites the system's default
            version with its own, and so you will be using Fink's version.

        VNC is a network-capable graphics display system similar in design to

        However, it works at a lower level, making implementation easier.
        With the Xvnc server and a Mac OS X display client, it is possible to

    <h3><a name="trouble.immediate-quit">6.1 When I launch X11, it quits
or crashes almost immediately</a></h3>
      
      <p>
        First of all: Don't Panic!
        There are lots of things than can go wrong with X11, and a good
        number of them can cause startup failures.
        Further, it is not unusual that X11 crashes when it experiences
        startup problems.
        This section tries to provide a comprehensive list of problems you may
        come across.
        But first, you need to gather two important pieces of information:
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Display server version.</b>
        You can find the version of the display server in the Finder by clicking
        <b>once</b> on the X11 or XQuartz icon and then selecting "Get Info"
        from the menu.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Error messages.</b>
These are essential in pinpointing the particular problem you
experience.
How you get the error messages depends on how you started X11.
If you ran <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">startx</tt> from a Terminal window, you'll have the
messages right there in that window.
Remember that you can scroll up.
If you started X11 by double-clicking the X11 or XQuartz icon, the messages end
up in the system log, which you can access through the Console
application in the Utilities folder.
Be sure to pick the right set of messages, e.g. the last one.
</p>
      <p>
We'll start with a list of the messages you may see:
</p>
      <pre>_XSERVTransmkdir: Owner of /tmp/.X11-unix should be set to root</pre>
      <pre>_IceTransmkdir: Owner of /tmp/.ICE-unix should be set to root</pre>
      <p>
Class: Harmless.
X11 creates hidden directories in /tmp to store the socket "files" for
local connections.
For security reasons, X11 prefers if these directories are owned by
root, but since they are world-writable anyway it will still run
without any problems.
(Note: It's quite hard to have these dirs owned by root, as Mac OS X
wipes out /tmp on reboots and X11 doesn't run with root privileges
and doesn't need to.)
    </p>
      <pre>cat: /Users/chrisp/.Xauthority: No such file or directory</pre>
      <p>
        Class: Mostly harmless.
        This issue seems to have no impact on operations.
        You can get rid of them by running <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">touch .Xauthority</tt> in
        your home directory.
    </p>
      <pre>Gdk-WARNING **: locale not supported by C library</pre>
      <p>
Class: Harmless.
This just means what it says and won't keep the application from
working.
For more information, <a href="#trouble.locale">see below</a>.
</p>
       <pre>Warning: no access to tty (Inappropriate ioctl for device).
Thus no job control in this shell.</pre>
      <p>
Class: Mostly harmless.
X11 launches an interactive shell behind the scenes
to run your client startup file (.xinitrc).
This was done so that you don't have to add statements to set up PATH
in that file.
Some shells complain that they're not connected to a real terminal,
but that can be ignored since that shell instance is not used for
anything that requires job control or the like.
</p>
      <pre>The XKEYBOARD keymap compiler (xkbcomp) reports:
&gt; Error:            Can't find file "unknown" for geometry include
&gt;                   Exiting
&gt;                   Abandoning geometry file "(null)"
Errors from xkbcomp are not fatal to the X server</pre>
      <p>
Class: Mostly harmless.
As the message says, it is not fatal.
To my knowledge, X11 on Macs doesn't use the XKB extension at all.
Probably some client program tries to use it anyway...
</p>
      <pre>startx: Command not found.</pre>
      <p>
        Class: Fatal.
        This can happen when your shell
        initialization files are not set up to add the X11 executable directory, e.g.
        <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">/usr/X11/bin</tt>, to the PATH variable.  Fink is normally set
        up to do this automatically, so this may indicate that your Fink environment
        isn't being loaded.  Running</p>
      <pre>/sw/bin/pathsetup.sh</pre>
      <p>
        in a terminal window, and then starting a new window, will typically resolve this.
      </p>
      <pre>_XSERVTransSocketUNIXCreateListener: ...SocketCreateListener() failed
_XSERVTransMakeAllCOTSServerListeners: server already running</pre>
      <pre>Fatal server error:
Cannot establish any listening sockets - Make sure an X server isn't already
running</pre>
      <p>
Class: Fatal.
This can happen when you accidentally run several instances of X11
at once,
or maybe after an unclean shutdown (i.e. crash) of X11.
It might also be a file permission problem with the sockets for local
connections.
You can try to clean that up with <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">rm -rf /tmp/.X11-unix</tt>.
Restarting the computer also helps in most cases (Mac OS X
automatically cleans up /tmp when it boots, and the network stack is
reset).
</p>
      <pre>Xlib: connection to ":0.0" refused by server
Xlib: Client is not authorized to connect to Server</pre>
      <p>
Class: Fatal.
The client programs can't connect to the display server (X11 or XQuartz)
because they use bogus authentication data.
This can be caused by some VNC installations,
by running X11-based apps through <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">sudo</tt>,
and probably some other freak accidents.
The usual fix is to delete the <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">.Xauthority</tt> file (which stores the
authentication data) in your home directory and re-create an empty
file:
</p>
      <pre>cd
rm .Xauthority
touch .Xauthority</pre>
      <p></p>
        <p><b>Possibly no obvious error:</b></p>
      <p>
Class: Fatal.
Probably the common cause for X11 startup failures is an incorrect startup file.
Typically, a window manager listed in <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">$HOME/.xinitrc</tt> or
<tt style="white-space: nowrap;">$HOME/.xinitrc.d</tt> doesn't get run due to
having been uninstalled, or not being in the PATH, or runs in
the background rather than the foreground due to having an '&amp;' at the end of its
line.  In any case, <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">$HOME/.xinitrc</tt> reaches its end, <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">xinit</tt>
interprets this as "the user's session has ended", and kills X11.  If the executable cannot be found,
there will be an error message to that effect in the terminal window or console log.  On the other hand,
if the last file has an '&amp;', there will be no error, but X11 will quit.
See the sections on <a href="#run-xfree86.xinitrc-d">.xinitrc.d</a> and
<a href="#run-xfree86.xinitrc">the .xinitrc file </a> for more details.</p>      
<p>To avoid this, remember to set up the PATH using</p>
<pre>. /sw/bin/init.sh</pre>
<p>in your startup files, 
and also to end with a long-lived program that is
not started in the background, e.g. a window manager or session manager with no '&amp;'.
You might also add <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">exec xterm</tt> as a fallback for when
your window manager or other long-lived item can't be found, e.g. if you remove it.
</p>
    
     <h3><a name="trouble.locale">6.2 "Warning: locale not supported by C library"</a></h3>
      
      <p>
These messages are quite common, but harmless.
It just means what it says - internationalization is not supported
through the standard C library, the program will use the default
English messages, date formats, and so on.
There are several ways to deal with this:
</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
Just ignore the messages.
</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
Get rid of the messages by unsetting the environment variable LANG.
Note that this will also turn internationalization off in programs
that actually support it (via gettext/libintl).
Example for .xinitrc:
</p>
          <pre>unset LANG</pre>
          <p>
Example for .cshrc:
</p>
          <pre>unsetenv LANG</pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
Ask Apple to include proper locale support in a future version of Mac
OS X.

      <p>
        Programs that require calling other programs which reside
        within your Fink tree for
        some of their functions may need special treatment to get them to work when called from the
        Application menu.  Instead of putting just the full path to the filename, e.g.</p>
        <pre>/sw/bin/emacs</pre>
          <p>

        application's name as you would for a command-line program, OS X will start X11 if it
        isn't already running, and then run your application.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Important Note:</b> Prior to 10.5, it was required to set the <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">DISPLAY</tt>
        environment variable in your terminal session for it to talk to X11.  <b>Don't</b> do
        this on 10.5 and later, since OS X automatically sets it to the right value.

    <h3><a name="tips.open">7.3 Launching Aqua apps from an xterm</a></h3>
      
      <p>
        One way to launch Aqua applications from an <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">xterm</tt> (or any other shell,
        actually) is the <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">open</tt> command.
        Some examples:
      </p>
      <pre>open /Applications/TextEdit.app
open SomeDocument.rtf
open -a /Applications/TextEdit.app index.html</pre>
      <p>
        The second example opens the document in the application that is
        associated with it, the third example explicitly gives an application
        to use.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">launch</tt> command from Fink's <b>launch</b> package works the same way,
        and provides some additional functionality.
      </p>
    
    <h3><a name="tips.copy-n-paste">7.4 Copy and Paste</a></h3>
      
      <p>
Copy and Paste generally works between the Aqua and X11 environments.
There are still some bugs.
Emacs is reported to be picky about the current selection.
Copy and paste from Classic to X11 doesn't work.
</p>
      <p>
Anyway, the trick is to use the respective methods of the environment
you're in.
To transfer text from Aqua to X11, use Cmd-C in Aqua, then bring the
destination window to the front and use the "middle mouse button", i.e. Option-click
on a single-button mouse (turn on "Emulate three button mouse" in the X11 Preferences), to paste.
To transfer text from X11 to Aqua, simply select the text with the
mouse in X11, use Cmd-C to copy it, then use Cmd-V in Aqua to paste it.  Depending on your OS
and X11 versions, you may also be able to use the copy function from your X11 application to copy
your selection, too.
      </p>
      <p>
        The X11 system actually has several separate clipboards (called "cut
buffers" in X11 speak), and some applications have weird views which
one should be used.
In particular, pasting into GNU Emacs or XEmacs sometimes hasn't worked
because of this.  Apple's <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">quartz-wm</tt> window manager smooths out synchronization between
the buffers.  If you want to use a different window manager, you can still get the benefits of
<tt style="white-space: nowrap;">quartz-wm</tt> on 10.5-10.7, by using the <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">--only-proxy</tt> flag:</p>
<pre>...
quartz-wm --only proxy &amp;
exec &lt;your window manager here&gt;
</pre>
      <p>Note:  this flag is no longer used in <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">quartz-wm</tt> from Xquartz-2.7.x .</p>
      <p>
        The program <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">autocutsel</tt> is deprecated, but is still available on 10.5 and 10.6
        if you don't want to use <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">quartz-wm --only proxy</tt>.
        It automatically synchronizes the two main cut buffers.
        To run it, install the <b>autocutsel</b> Fink package and add the following
        line to your <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">.xinitrc</tt> or in its own <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">.xinitrc.d</tt>
        shell script:
      </p>
      <pre>autocutsel &amp;</pre>
      <p>
        (Make sure this runs <b>before</b> the line that exec's the window
        manager and never returns! Don't just add it at the end, it won't
        be executed.)
      </p>
      <p>
        In any case, if you encounter problems copying or pasting from Aqua to X11 and vice-versa,
        you may first try to do the pasting part twice (it may happen that the copy does not occur
        at once), then use intermediate applications, e.g. TextEdit or Terminal.app on the Aqua side,
        nedit or an xterm on the X11 side. In my experience, there is always a solution.
