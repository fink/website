<h1>Porting - 3. GNU libtool</h1>




<p>
GNU packages that build libraries use GNU libtool to hide
platform-dependent procedures for library building and installation.
</p>


<h2><a name="situation">3.1 The Situation</a></h2>
<p>
In the wild, one can find four strands of libtool:
</p>
<ul>

<li><p>
<b>libtool 1.3</b>:
The most common strand.
The last release from this branch is 1.3.5.
It doesn't know about Darwin and only builds static libraries.
It can be recognized by the presence of the files
<code>ltconfig</code> and <code>ltmain.sh</code> in
the source tree.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<b>libtool 1.4</b>:
Long in the works and recently released as the new
stable version, this branch has better autoconf integration.
Unfortunately that makes migrating packages from 1.3 non-trivial.
It supports Darwin 1.3 / Mac OS X 10.0 out of the box and needs a
small patch to work on Mac OS X 10.1.
It can be recognized by the absence of <code>ltconfig</code>.
Versions that identify themselves as 1.3b or 1.3d are actually
development snapshots of 1.4 and must be treated with caution.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<b>The multi-language-branch</b>:
Also called MLB, this version of libtool was a parallel development
branch that added support for C++ and Java (via gcj).
It has now been merged back into the main development line.
Recent versions support Darwin 1.3 and Mac OS X 10.0 out of the box.
The MLB can be recognized by the files <code>ltcf-c.sh</code>,
<code>ltcf-cxx.sh</code> and <code>ltcf-gcj.sh</code>.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<b>The current development branch</b>:
This is the development version that will some day be released as
libtool 1.5.
It has resulted from the merge of 1.4 and the MLB.
It supports C, C++ and Java (via gcj).
Unfortunately, it can't be easily told apart from 1.4, you'll have to
check the version number inside <code>ltmain.sh</code>.
</p></li>

</ul>
<p>
In conclusion, libtool 1.3.x and packages that use it (which
happens to be the majority of libtool-using packages out there) need a
patch to build shared libraries on Darwin.
Apple includes a patched version of libtool 1.3.5 in Mac OS X, but it
will not work correctly in most cases.
Christoph Pfisterer improved that patch to hardcode the correct path and to 
do full versioning.
The changes were incorporated into upstream libtool releases and
development versions starting with 1.4.
Members of the Fink team continue to make improvements and forward them to 
the libtool maintainers.
The versioning scheme is compatible across all libtool versions.
</p>
<p>
Side note:
The libltdl library included with all libtool versions will only work
on Darwin when dlcompat is installed.
This is included with OS X starting with 10.3. For previous versions,
one can install the fink "dlcompat" family of packages.
</p>



<h2><a name="patch-135">3.2 The 1.3.5 Patch</a></h2>
<p>
If you are building libtool 1.3.5 for yourself, you will need to apply
<a href="/files/libtool-1.3.5-darwin.patch">this
patch</a> <b>[updated 2002-06-09]</b> to the libtool 1.3.5 source and
then delete the files ltconfig and ltmain.sh.
(They will be recreated from the appropriate .in files when you run
configure and make.)  This is done automatically, by the way, in the 
current Fink package for libtool 1.3.5.</p><p>
But that's only half the work - every package using libtool comes with
its own copies of <code>ltconfig</code> and <code>ltmain.sh</code>.
So you must replace these in every package that you want to build as a
shared library.
Note that you must do this before running the configure script.
For your convenience, you can get the two files right here:
<a href="/files/ltconfig">ltconfig</a> (98K) and
<a href="/files/ltmain.sh">ltmain.sh</a> (110K)
<b>[both updated 2002-06-09]</b>.</p>


<h2><a name="fixing-14x">3.3 Fixing 1.4.x</a></h2>
<p>
There are at least three different versions of libtool 1.4.x now in wide use
(1.4.1, 1.4.2, and later development snapshots). They all have some issues on
Darwin, though the exact changes required to fix them differ. The "libtool14"
package shipped via Fink has all required patches already applied to it.
However, you still have to manually fix the <code>ltmain.sh</code> and <code>configure</code> files of
affected packages in order to get them working.

<li>
<b>The flat_namespace bug</b>:
This problem only occurs if you use libtool on Mac OS X10.1 and later. What happens
is that libtool tries to use the <code>-undefined suppress</code> to allow undefined
symbols, but doesn't specify along with it the <code>-flat_namespace</code> option.
Starting with 10.1 this won't work anymore. A typical patch looks like this:

<b>The loadable module bug</b>:
This bug is caused by the non-standard behaviour of zsh (which is the default
shell in 10.0 and 10.1; starting in 10.2 bash is the default).
Zsh's non-standard quoting behaviours prevents loadable module from being built
correctly, they end up as shared libraries instead (unlike Linux, these are
reall different things on Darwin). A typical fix for this (cut off, so you can't
use it unmodified):

<b>The convenience library bug</b>:
Under some conditions, libtool will fail to link convenience libraries, 
giving "multiple definitions" errors.
This is caused by a more fundamental problem in libtool it seems. For now 
as a workaround (curing the symptoms
not the actual problem, but with great success anyway), you can use this fix
(thanks to Dave Vasilevsky):

Side note:
Apple's Developer Tools contain a program also called libtool, which
is used by the compiler driver to build shared libraries.
However, this is completely unrelated with GNU libtool.
The GNU libtool that Apple ships is installed as <code>glibtool</code>
instead.
This can be achieved by configuring GNU libtool with
<code>--program-transform-name=s/libtool/glibtool/</code>.
