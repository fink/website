<h1>Fink Downloads</h1>
<p>
There are many ways to install or upgrade Fink.
For new users, the quick start instructions below are recommended.
Otherwise, check out the <a href="overview.php">overview</a> and the
<a href="upgrade.php">upgrade matrix</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="quickstart">Quick Start</h2>
<p>
New to Fink?  These quick start instructions are here to get you up to speed
with the binary release.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>10.6 to 10.15 users: There is not currently a binary installer, and you will
need to follow the <A href="srcdist.php">source install</A> instructions instead.<br>
10.5 users:  
Download the installer disk image:<br>
<?php analytics_download_link("http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/fink/Fink-" . $fink_version . "-PowerPC-Installer.dmg?download", "Fink " . $fink_version . " Binary Installer (PowerPC)", "/downloads/FinkPPC")   ?> - <?php echo $dmg_size ?><br>
<?php analytics_download_link("http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/fink/Fink-" . $fink_version . "-Intel-Installer.dmg?download",   "Fink " . $fink_version . " Binary Installer (Intel)",   "/downloads/FinkINTEL") ?> - <?php echo $intel_dmg_size ?><br>
10.4 users - use  <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/fink/Fink-0.8.1-PowerPC-Installer.dmg?download">Fink
0.8.1 (PowerPC)</A> or <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/fink/Fink-0.8.1-Intel-Installer.dmg?download">Fink
0.8.1 (Intel)</a>)<br>
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
Double-click &quot;Fink-<?php print $fink_version; ?>-XYZ-Installer.dmg&quot; (where XYZ is either PowerPC or Intel) to mount the disk image,
then double-click the &quot;Fink <?php print $fink_version; ?> XYZ Installer.pkg&quot; package
inside. Follow the instructions on screen.
</p></li>
<li><p>
At the end of the installation, the pathsetup utility will be launched.
You will be asked for permission before your shell's configuration files
are edited. When the utility has finished, you are set to go!
</p></li>
<li><p>
If anything goes wrong during this process, you can try again by launching 
the pathsetup application which appears on the installer disk, or by
running (from the command line in a Terminal.app window) 
</p><pre>/sw/bin/pathsetup.sh</pre><p>
(This step should also be repeated by any other users on your system: 
each user must run pathsetup in his or her own account.)
</p><p>
If pathsetup generates error messages, consult the documentation, 
particularly 
<a href="../doc/users-guide/install.php#setup">section
2.3 &quot;Setting Up Your Environment&quot;</a> of the User's Guide.</p>
</li>
<li><p>
Open a new Terminal.app window and run the following: &quot;<code>fink scanpackages; fink index</code>&quot;, or use the included Fink Commander GUI application (which must be placed in a real folder on your system, not run from the disk image) and run the following commands from its menu:  <em>Source-&gt;scanpackages</em> followed by <em>Source-&gt;Utilities-&gt;index</em>.
</p></li>
<li><p>Once those two commands are finished you should update the <code>fink</code> package, in case there have been significant changes since the last point release.  After you do this you can install other packages.  There are several ways to do this:
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use the included Fink Commander to select and install packages. Fink Commander provides an easy to use GUI for Fink. This is the recommended method for new users, or users who are not comfortable with the command line.  Fink Commander has Binary and Source menus.  You should install from binaries if you don't have the Developer Tools installed, or don't want to build packages yourself.</p>
<ul><li><p>The Fink Commander sequence to update <code>fink</code> from binaries is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Binary-&gt;Update descriptions</li>
<li>Select the <code>fink</code> package.</li>
<li>Binary-&gt;Install</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The recommended Fink Commander sequence to update <code>fink</code> from source is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Source-&gt;Selfupdate</li> 
<li>Tools-&gt;Interact with Fink...
<li>Make sure &quot;Accept default response&quot; is selected, and click &quot;Submit&quot;.</li>
<li><code>fink</code> and other base packages will be built and run automatically</li>
</ol></li></ul>
<p>Now that you've updated <code>fink</code>, you can install other packages.</p>
<ul>
<li>To install from binaries, select the package, and use Binary-&gt;Install.</li>
<li>To install from source, select the package, and use Source-&gt;Install</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use apt-get. Apt-get will fetch and install binary packages for you, saving compiling time.  You should either use this method or the Fink Commander binary method (above) if you don't have the Developer Tools installed.</p>
<p>To update <code>fink</code> open a Terminal.app window and type <code> sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get install fink</code></p>
<p>Once you've updated <code>fink</code>, you can install other packages, using the same syntax, e.g <code>sudo apt-get install gimp</code> to install the Gimp.  Note, however, that not all fink packages are in binary form.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install from source (requires the Xcode Tools [Developer Tools on 10.2] to be installed).
To update <code>fink</code> run <code>fink selfupdate</code>.  When prompted, select option (1), &quot;rsync&quot;.  This will automatically update the <code>fink</code> package.</p>
<p>Once <code>fink</code> is updated, you can use &quot;<code>fink install</code>&quot; to fetch and compile from source code.  For example, to install the Gimp, run <code>fink install gimp</code>.</p> 
</li> 
</ul>

</li> 
</ol>

<h2 id="additionaldownloads">Additional Things to Install</h2>
<h3>Xcode Tools/Developer Tools</h3>
<p>To build packages from source, which Fink currently requires on supported OS versions, you will need to install the Developer Tools.</p>
<p>Go to <a href="http://developer.apple.com">the Apple Developer site</a> to download a newer version (and any updates) after free registration.</p>

<h3>X11</h3>
      <p>Most of the applications on Fink that have graphical user interfaces (GUIs) require some flavor of X11 (since most were originally developed on platforms that only had that as a GUI option).</p>
      <p>Apple provides its own X11 distribution.  This is
the easiest option with which to get started.  They have elected to split it into two parts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The <em>X11User</em> package contains everything you need just to run Apple's X11.  It is available on your OS install media for 10.4 as an
 optional install, and is installed by default on 10.5 and later.</li>
        <li>The
<em>X11SDK</em>
package contains the development headers.  You need this if you want to build anything from source that uses X11.  This package is available as part of the Xcode Tools, and installed by default with Xcode 2.x and later.</li>
<li>The <em>2006 X11 Update</em> for 10.4 (available via Software Update or manual download) is supported.</li>
<li>All official updates for X11 on 10.5 - 10.7 are supported.</li>
<li>The <em>Xquartz X11 distribution</em> from
<a href="http://xquartz.macosforge.org">macosforge.org</a> is only supported on 10.5 (Xquartz version 2.6.3 and earlier), where it 
replaces the official X11, and 10.8 and 10.9, where it <em>is</em> the official X11.  This does not have separate runtime and header packages.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you've installed X11 Fink should automatically register it.  If you're having problems check out the <a href="http://www.finkproject.org/faq/usage-packages.php?phpLang=en#apple-x11-wants-xfree86">FAQ entry</a> on X11 installation problems</p>
