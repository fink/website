In addition to the php files for the web site, this directory stores
information about the version number of the latest (complete) Fink 
distribution, which is consulted by users' copies of Fink when using the 
"point" update method.

These days, each complete Fink distribution is tuned to a particular
"tree", such as 10.2-gcc3.3.  As of this writing, there are five files
containing tree-specific version information:

  CURRENT-FINK-10.2 (most likely frozen forever with value "0.5.4")
  CURRENT-FINK-10.2-gcc3.3
  CURRENT-FINK-10.3
  CURRENT-FINK-10.4
  CURRENT-FINK-10.5

The users' copy of Fink consults the "Distibution:" line in /sw/etc/fink.conf
in order to decide which of these version numbers to fetch.

(All but the first of these contain the distribution in the number, such
as 10.5-0.9.0.)

Note that access to source files corresponding to the "updates" portion
of the binary distribution is now provided by a version number with a
four decimal part after the distribution, such as 10.5-0.9.0.1.  It is assumed 
that users will have installed the 10.5-0.9.0 distribution prior to installing 
10.5-0.9.0.1, but 10.5-0.9.0.2 is supposed to be cumulative for the changes 
(a complete diff from 10.5-0.9.0).

To maintain compatibility with earlier versions of this system, the
directory also contains two legacy files:
  LATEST-FINK (with the value "0.4.1a", used by 10.1)
  CURRENT-FINK (with the value "0.5.4", used by 10.2 in upgrading to
                the tree-specific system described above.)


NOTE:  For use on the web site, the current fink version number must also be 
supplied in three places: fink_version.inc, xml/finkdoc.dtd, xml/finkfaq.dtd.
This is the three-part number, not the four-part "updates" number.


IMPORTANT NOTE: As of 29 June 2003, the CVS modules have been somewhat
rearranged.  It is no longer advisible to check out the "web" module from
CVS.  If you want the website contents, check out the "website" module.
If you want to be able to edit the documentation, including the website,
check out the "xml" module.
