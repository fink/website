<a name="2003-10-25 Look Ma, a logo for Fink"><span class="news-date">2003-10-25: </span><span class="news-headline">Look Ma, a logo for Fink</span></a><?php gray_line(); ?>
	<p>As you surely noticed, Fink has a logo. This is the result of our
	Logo <a href="<?php print $root; ?>logo.php">contest</a> held earlier this year.
	This new, official, logo has been displayed since the 24th of October and
	those of you who wondered how it has been picked and what the name of the
	winner is should read up in the PR <a href="<?php print $root; ?>pr/index.php">section</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
	The longer explanation also features a larger version of the logo itself,
	so that you may have a closer look at its details. We like our new logo,
	we hope that you will like it too.
	</p>
	<p>IMPORTANT: We do not yet have a formal licensing agreement for the new
   logo and so are unable to give permission to distribute it.  Currently, it
   can only be displayed on the Fink web page.  Thank you for your understanding.

		<a name="2003-10-24 Upgrade to gcc 3.3 and/or 10.3"><span class="news-date">2003-10-24: </span><span class="news-headline">Upgrade to gcc 3.3 and/or 10.3</span></a><?php gray_line(); ?>
	<p>It is now possible to upgrade Fink to take full advantage of the gcc 3.3
compiler, or to use OS X 10.3 if you have that installed.  Binary packages
corresponding to these upgrades are not yet available, so if you make 
extensive use of binary packages you may wish to wait a few days before 
upgrading.
</p><p>
If you wish to perform this upgrade, and you had previously installed the
June 2003 Developer Tools update from Apple, you will need to install
the August 2003 Developer Tools update BEFORE you upgrade Fink.  Under
10.3, be sure to install XCode from the XCode disk before upgrading
Fink.
</p><p>
Running "fink selfupdate" should perform the upgrade for you.  The latest
version of the fink package manager will automatically detect which
version of OS X and which version of gcc you have installed, and will
adjust itself accordingly.
</p><p>
If you wish to do a fresh install of Fink on a 10.3 system, we recommend
<a href="http://fink.sf.net/download/srcdist.php">bootstrapping from
source,</a> starting from fink-full-0.6.0.tar.gz available
on fink's <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=17203">sourceforge 
download page.</a>  You'll need XCode for this as
well.
</p><p>
Also note that once you have Fink version 0.15.0 or higher, you do
not need to install system-xfree86 anymore.  Fink is
capable of automatically determining your system-xfree86 version if you
don't already have any fink x11 packages installed.  If you currently
have an old system-xfree86 package of any kind installed, please run the
following (all on one line):
</p>
<p>
<b>sudo dpkg -r --force-all system-xfree86 system-xfree86-42 system-xfree86-43;
fink selfupdate; fink index</b>
</p>
<p>
The Fink team is still working on getting Fink packages working under 10.3,
but many many packages already work.

<p>The latest version of the fink package manager offers a new update
method, <code>fink selfupdate-rsync</code>, as an alternative to the
CVS updates which have been so problematic in the past few months.
If you have difficulty updating to the new version, please follow
<a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/download/rsync-upgrade.php">these 
special update instructions</a>.
</p>
<p>In addition, this version of the fink package manager is compatible
with last summer's Developer Tools updates.  After installing both the new
package manager and the Developer Tools update, 
fink will ask you to reset your gcc version whenever
that is necessary.</p>

<p>As announced in <a href="http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2003-21.html">this CERT 
advisory</a>, it has recently been discovered that
the ftp servers for GNU software were compromised back in March, 
although it is not believed that any of the source code housed there
was affected.
</p><p>
Fink relies on MD5 checksums when downloading software, and we have had
no reports of incorrect checksums in Fink packages.  The Free Software
Foundation is in the process of verifying the integrity of all of the
source code distributed from that ftp site.  As of this writing, the source
code for the following Fink packages have not yet been verified:
<code>autoconf2.54</code>,
<code>emacs21</code>,
<code>gprolog</code>,
<code>groff</code>,
<code>guile16</code>,
<code>help2man</code>,
<code>jwhois</code>,
<code>libtool14</code>,
<code>libosip1</code>,
<code>sed</code>,
<code>slib</code>.
It may be difficult to install those packages at present.

<p><b>Quick Summary: DO NOT INSTALL THIS UPDATE.</b></p>
               <p>
Apple has released a patch to the December 2002 
Developer Tools which includes gcc 3.3,
their new compiler.
</p><p>
Fink does not yet support compiling with gcc 3.3.  In addition, it is important
not to "mix and match" between compilers:  all C++ code in fink packages
needs to be compiled
with the same compiler.
</p><p>
For this reason, the Fink team recommends that if you update your
Developer Tools with the new patch, you should be careful to run
<code>sudo gcc_select 3</code>
prior to any "fink build" or "fink install" commands.
</p>
<p><b>Update 30 June 2003:</b> A 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=2680195&amp;forum_id=2056">problem
has now been detected</a> with
the new assembler program which the update installs, which may prevent
certain Fink packages from being compiled at all if you install this
update.  
</p>
<p><b>Generally, Fortran programs will break if you install the update;
the breakage does not stop by simply switching back to gcc 3.1.</b>
The Fink team is working on a workaround for this problem, but until it
is ready, if you need Fortran-related programs you should not install
the update.</p>

	<p>
	While Apple's X11 works just fine with existing binaries, it
has a bug in the install name of the libraries that can cause some
software to build incorrectly, and will break forward-compatibility
with future X11 releases.
</p>
<p>
	Ben Hines has created a script (available <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/fink/fix-fink/install_name_fix.pl">here</a>) that you can use
that will fix the install_name entries in Apple's X11 libraries,
but it will not repair software you have already built against the
broken libraries.

<p><b>Update 11 February 2003:</b> This script is not needed with 
version 0.2 of Apple's X11.app which was released yesterday.

	<p>
        A problem was uncovered today concerning the versions of imlib,
 libpng, and gnome in Fink's unstable tree.  The Fink team is hard at
 work addressing this problem.  As a workaround, users can downgrade
their imlib package to the stable version, "<code>fink install
 imlib-1.9.10-9</code>", until the problem is fixed.
</p><p>
   Many Fink users may be using Fink's unstable tree without being
fully aware of what this entails.  For a few months in the fall,
enabling the unstable tree was the only way to gain access to
 10.2-compatible versions of Fink packages.  
<b>That is no longer the case.</b>
Fink users who do not wish to help the Fink team with testing should
disable their unstable tree.  To do this, edit the file
<code>/sw/etc/fink.conf</code> and remove the items
 <code>unstable/main</code> and <code>unstable/crypto</code> from the
 <code>Trees</code> line.
	</p>
<p>The Fink team appreciates those users who are willing to stick with
the unstable tree, even when there are problems like today's, and provide
the team with prompt feedback.  This is a community effort and we
appreciate your participation.

Installer.app program, attempting a second installation on the same
machine can result in permissions being altered in the machine's root
directory, in some cases leaving the machine in a non-bootable state.
</p><p> If Installer.app presents you with an "Upgrade" button rather
than an "Install" button when installing Fink 0.4.1, <b>do not proceed
any further!</b> </p>
<p>A new version of the binary installer for Fink 0.4.1 became available
on November 5.  The new version avoids
the problem of the machine not booting, but even with the new version,
users are advised to only "Install",
not "Upgrade."  (You can recognize the new version by its filesize of
12582912 bytes, while the old version had a filesize of 10541112 bytes.)

    This is the <b>last release for Mac OS X 10.1</b>. Future versions of Fink will <b>not</b> officially support Mac OS X 10.1 anymore, we are gearing all our efforts towards 10.2.
    </p>
    <p>
    At the same time, this release is not meant for Mac OS X 10.2. Fink 0.5.0. which is targeted for October, will be geared towards 10.2. In the meantime refer to the news item below on how to upgrade Fink for 10.2.

			A test version of the 10.2 updater for Fink is now available. The update process is somewhat complicated at the moment, but is explained in <a href="<?php print $root; ?>news/jaguar.php">step-by-step instructions for updating</a>. We also have separate <a href="<?php print $root; ?>news/jag-bootstrap.php">instructions to install Fink from scratch on 10.2</a>. 
		</p>
		<p>
			At the moment, approximately 800 out of 1150 Fink packages have been made ready for 10.2. However, virtually all of these packages are still being tested and have not yet been moved to the "stable" tree in the 10.2 section; moreover, binaries for 10.2 packages are not yet available.

    <p>
      During the last few weeks, we got a lot of emails asking whether Fink will work Mac OS X 10.2.
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer is: Yes, we will support 10.2. However, due to some
      major changes in this new OS version, we had to make a lot of adjustments both
      to the Fink tool itself and to many packages. The current binary distribution,
      0.4.0a, will only work partially on 10.2. We are working on an upgrade guide,
      as well as a new Fink release, to support 10.2.
    </p>
	<p>
	 If you upgrade your system to 10.2 before the official Fink update for 10.2 is ready,
	 many Fink packages built on 10.1 are going to work fine, but others need to be rebuilt.
	 Some packages need special changes to build on 10.2. Adding "unstable/main" to your
	 list of trees in /sw/etc/fink.conf (see also the <a href="<?php print $root; ?>faq/usage-fink.php#unstable">FAQ</a>)
	 will give you access to the latest versions of packages, many of which include important
	 fixes for 10.2.
	</p>
    <p>
     As of now, please do not email us asking about 10.2 support. If you can't wait,
     consult the <a href="<?php print $root; ?>lists/index.php">mailing list archives</a> instead.

    <p>
      Yesterday version 0.10.0 of the Fink package manager was released to the unstable tree, along with version 1.6 of the base-files package. All Fink users which are using the unstable tree are recommended to update to this version. The easiest way to do so usually is to run 'fink selfupdate-cvs' which will automatically take care of updating these essential packages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please report any problems you encounter with this version via our bug tracker.

    <p>
      All Fink users are urged to update their <b> passwd </b> package to version 20020329 or newer. Older versions of the <b> passwd </b> package are affected by a bug which could lead to the loss of all data on your hard disk if you remove system users created by Fink manually from the system via System Preferences. (Removing them via the NetInfo tool is safe.) You can check the version of your passwd package by entering <b> dpkg -s passwd</b>. If your version is oudated, you can update to the current one in two ways: 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Via the binary distribution. First make sure you have the latest list of packages available: <b> sudo apt-get update</b>. Then you can perform the actual update: <b> sudo apt-get install passwd</b>. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Via the source distribution. First make sure you have the latest set of package descriptions: <b> fink selfupdate-cvs</b>. Then, update the passwd package: <b> fink update passwd</b> 
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      See <a href="<?php print $root; ?>faq/usage-general.php#passwd">Fink's FAQ, question 6.3,</a> for more information about the passwd package.
