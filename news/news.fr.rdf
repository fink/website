      <p>Our user services have been restored. On Oct 28th the Web site and
      some of the mirrors (rsync, source files, binary distribution) were
      restored, and on Oct 30th all of our main rsync mirrors were operational.
      Once again, we apologise for the inconvenience. Thanks for your patience

Fink is ready to be used on Snow Leopard (OS X v. 10.6).  Users will
need to choose between a 32-bit version of fink and a 64-bit version of fink
for 10.6.
The 32-bit version has more packages available at the present time, but
the 64-bit version represents the future direction for OS X and for fink;
individual users must make this decision on their own.  It will not
be possible to "upgrade" from 32-bit to 64-bit (or vice versa), without
completely reinstalling fink.
</p><p>
At the moment, two methods are available for installing Fink on Snow Leopard.
A binary installer is not available, so it is important to
first install XCode from the Optional Installs folder on the Snow
Leopard disk.
Users wanting the 64-bit version, or users upgrading directly from 10.4 or
earlier, must bootstrap fink from the distribution tarball (version
0.29.9 or later), available at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/fink/files/fink/0.29.9/fink-0.29.9.tar.gz/download">sourceforge.net</a>; installation instructions are
<a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/download/srcdist.php">here</a>.
On the other hand, users can upgrade directly from
10.5 to the 32-bit version, following the instructions below.
(One warning: users who have installed a development version of fink
from CVS rather than a released version may encounter trouble; please
downgrade your fink to a released version, and remove stray .deb files
of higher versions, before beginning.)
</p><p>
To upgrade, follow a four step process.
Step 1: edit the file /sw/etc/fink.conf,
adding a line to it which reads NoAutoIndex: true  (You may
need to use sudo to obtain the correct permissions to edit
this file.)  Step 2: 
run the command fink reinstall fink in
order to tell fink that you are now on 10.6.  (If you encounter a message
about package database corruption, run fink index -f and
try this step again.)  Step 3: 
run the command fink update
fink to get the latest fink for 10.6.  Step 4: run the command
fink install perl588-core to replace the version of perl
which Apple changed during the OS X upgrade, in case you have 
fink packages which depend on it.
</p><p>After the upgrade, you may wish to run fink configure
to do some cleanup.
</p><p>Almost all of the packages in fink's stable tree will compile on
10.6, but be warned that only a fraction of the 10.5 packages are currently
available for 10.6.  In the near future, fink's package database will be
updated to include information about packages for 10.6; you can check there
to see if your favorite package is ready.

The Fink Core Group announces two new members: Alexander Hansen (akh)
and Augusto Devegili (monipol), both of whom have been very active
in fink.  Please join us in welcoming the new members!
</p><p>
The Group also announces that Christian Schaffner has stepped down,
returning to "ordinary member" status.  We thank Christian for his help
on the team over the past several years.
</p><p>
Members of the Fink project are working hard to provide user support,
to keep Fink up to date, and to prepare for the upcoming Snow Leopard
release.  More volunteers are always needed, so please consider
getting involved at some level!

The Fink project is no longer able to offer support for users of Fink
on Mac OS X 10.3. In reality there has been very little support for
some time, so this announcement simply formalizes that fact.
</p><p>
This means that there will not be any further updates, not even
security updates, for Mac OS X 10.3 users. Their existing
installations will continue to work, but the software that is
installed will not be updated.
</p><p>
We believe that the majority of our users are using Mac OS X 10.4 or
10.5 and hope that this does not inconvenience too many people.

The massive GNOME update which has been in process for
many months was merged into fink's unstable tree.  This is well
tested, and updates by users appear to be going fairly smoothly.
</p><p>
We are now merging the gnome update into the stable tree.  Because
we have been unable to test the dependencies of these new packages in
the stable tree in advance, users can expect the "stable" tree to be
"not so stable" during the next few weeks, while the bugs get worked
out.
</p><p>
If you are eager to start using this massive gnome update immediately,
we suggest that you switch to the unstable tree.  If not, we suggest
that you hold off running "fink selfupdate" for a while (perhaps a
week or two) until things have again stabilized.</p>

A new (binary) Fink release for OS X 10.5 (Leopard) is 
<a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/download/index.php">available</a>
 today: version 0.9.0, which can be installed on either Intel or PowerPC
hardware.
The release includes source files, binary packages, and  Fink
installers for both kinds of hardware.
</p>
      <p>
Users who have already installed Fink on Leopard from source, who now wish
to switch to the binary distribution, may do so as follows.  First,
run fink selfupdate to update to the latest version of the
fink package manager.  Next, run fink configure, and be sure
to change your choice about using the binary distribution from No
to yes.  Finally, run fink scanpackages to activate the binary
distribution.
</p>
<p>Update, 2008-07-11: If you use the binary installer, you
should run fink selfupdate after installation.</p>

Every large open source project has to face the problem of distribution and Fink is no different. We want you to get all the files you need to build your favourite application as quickly as possible. A mirror close to your location is a first step to achieving that. 
</p>
		<p>
We are actively working on building a reliable distribution infrastructure consisting of mirrors sponsored by universities and corporations. 
Recently our list of mirrors had to be shortened considerably and we need your help to improve its level of quality again.
</p>
	<p>
Are you a student? Are you a professor? Do you run a Data Center? Are you a developer with free time to spare? Even if you cannot say yes to any of those questions you still might be able to help.
All the relevant information on how to run and sponsor a mirror can be found on the <a href="http://wiki.finkproject.org/index.php/Fink:FinkMirrors">FinkWiki</a>.
For specific questions you can <a href="mailto:fink-core-private@lists.sourceforge.net">contact us</a> directly.
We are looking for mirrors all over the world, but specifically in these countries:</p>
United StatesJapanGermanyFranceUnited KingdomCanadaItalySpainSwitzerlandAustralia
	<p>
We would like to take this opportunity to thank those who are already providing Fink with mirrors. Without your continued support Fink would not be able to provide the level of service it currently does. Thank you!

	correctement. (Note: la version 2.1.1 est en cours de développement. Cette
	version ne nécessitera plus le besoin d'appliquer la rustine à Xquartz. Si

    <p>Mise à jour, 2007-12-11: La version 2.1.1 de X11
	<a href="http://trac.macosforge.org/projects/xquartz/wiki/Releases">est
	maintenant disponible sur la page de téléchargement de XQuartz</a>. Les
	utilisateurs qui ont déjà installé le fichier X11-2.1.0.1.pkg et/ou la rustine
	Xquartz-1.3.0-apple-fink depuis macosxforge.org doivent faire une mise à jour
	vers la version 2.1.1 ou une version plus récente, pour que Fink fonctionne
	correctement. Cette version remplace toutes les versions précédentes, y compris
	la version spécifique à Fink.</p>

    <p>L'interface web de gestion des paquets ne marche plus. La base de données est arrêtée suite à des mises à jour matériels et logiciels du serveur. Nous travaillons pour rétablir ce serveur dès que possible. Désolé pour la gêne occasionée.</p>
<p>Actualisé le 12 décembre: La base de données des paquets est 
rétablie, et l'interface web est à nouveau opérationnelle, avec de nouvelles 
fonctionnalités.</p>

    <p>Le projet Fink annonce le commencement du support pour Leopard (Mac OS X 10.5).</p>
<p>Les utilisateurs de 10.5 démarrant une nouvelle arborescence Fink devront le faire via bootstrap, tant qu'une distribution binaire ne sera pas disponible. <a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/fink/fink-0.27.7.tar.gz">Téléchargez la version 0.27.7 de Fink</a>.</p>
<p>La mise à jour de 10.4 vers 10.5 pour Fink peut s'effectuer en exécutant la commande fink selfupdate pour installer fink-0.27.7. Si vous êtes déjà sous 10.5, vérifiez d'abord que Xcode 3.0 est installé. Une fois 10.5 installé, exécutez ensuite fink reinstall fink.</p>
<p>La mise à jour de 10.3 vers 10.5 n'est pas encore prête. Si vous êtes impatient(e), vous devrez alors démarrer une nouvelle arborescence via bootstrap avec fink-0.27.7.</p>
<p>Actualisé le 29 octobre: Attention, pour les utilisateurs qui installent la mise à jour Leopard, exécuter la commande fink cleanup supprimera l'ensemble de vos fichiers .deb. La prochaine version de Fink corrigera ce problème.</p>

<p>Certains utilisateurs de la branche instable rencontre des difficultés lors de la génération de paquets de grandes tailles, en ayant des avertissements comme tar: File changed as we read it, ce qui empêche la création du paquet .deb.
</p><p>
L'équipe travaille actuellement sur la résolution définitive de ce problème. Pour l'instant, les utilisateurs confrontés à cette situtation peuvent la contourner en exécutant la commande fink install tar-1.15.1-14. Il peut s'avérer nécessaire de renouveler cette étape après chaque commande fink update-all. 
</p><p>
Une annonce sera postée ici même dès la correction effectuée.
</p>
<p>Actualisé le 16 mars: la nouvelle version de dpkg résout ce problème. Les utilisateurs peuvent exécuter normalement leurs commandes de mises à jour.

<p>Mise à jour du 21/08/2006  : le serveur est de nouveau accessible.</p>
<p>Le serveur qui héberge quatre services fink important (mise à jour via rsync, distribution binaire, "serveur maître" des fichiers sources et base de données des paquets) est inaccessible en ce moment. Nous espérons qu'il sera de nouveau fonctionnel lundi 21 août. Voici les solutions provisoires à votre disposition pendant l'indisponibilité du serveur.</p>
<p>Pour mettre à jours fink, vous devez soit choisir un miroir rsync différent du miroir primaire (voir le paragraphe suivant, soit utilisez la commmande fink selfupdate-cvs. Cette commande ne doit être utilisée qu'une seule fois ; les mises à jour suivantes se feront automatiquement via CVS. Quand le serveur sera de nouveau fonctionnel, vous pourrez revenir à la mise à jour via rsync en exécutant la commande fink selfupdate-rsync.</p>
<p>Pour pallier l'absence de distribution binaire et celle du "serveur primaire" des fichiers sources, exécutez la commande fink configure. Acceptez les réponses par défaut à toutes les questions, sauf à celles-ci: "Fink doit-il télécharger les paquets pré-compilés de la distribution binaire s'ils existent ?" (en anglais "Should Fink try to download pre-compiled packages from the binary distribution if available?"). Répondez alors "no" (en français "non") pour désactiver la distribution binaire. "Voulez-vous changer les miroirs ?" (en anglais "Do you want the change the mirror settings?"). Répondez "yes" (en français "oui"). "Dans quel ordre les miroirs doivent-ils être utilisés pour le téléchargement des sources ?" (en anglais ("What mirror order should fink use when downloading sources?". Répondez "2: Search Master Mirrors last" (en français "2 : Rechercher sur les miroirs maîtres en dernier lieu") pour désactiver l'utilisation automatique du serveur miroir maître). Enfin, si vous décidez de continuer à faire les mises à jour via rsync, vous devez choisir un autre miroir que rsync://master.us.finkmirrors.net/finkinfo/ en réponse à la question "Choisissez un miroir pour 'les mises à jour rsync'" (en anglais "Choose a mirror for 'RSync SelfUpdate'". Malheureusement, il se peut qu'aucun autre choix ne vous soit possible si vous habitez aux États-Unis.</p>
<p>Enfin, pour utiliser la base de données des paquets pendant la période d'indisponibilité du serveur, connectez-vous à <a href="http://pdb.finkproject.org/pdb/">cette copie de sauvegarde de la base de données des paquets</a>. Sachez, toutefois, qu'elle a quelques semaines de retard.</p>

<p> Update: 2 June 2007.  Due to changes to the behavior of sudo on 10.4.9, the update script needs a bit of assistance.  Switching to a superuser prompt first via sudo -s will suffice.</p>

<p>L'arborescence "10.4-transitional" fut créée pour résoudre de façon provisoire les incompatibilités entre binaires construits à partir de GCC 3.3 (le compilateur par défaut du système Mac OS X 10.3) et GCC 4.0 (le compilateur par défaut du système Mac OS X 10.4). À présent que Fink utilise GCC 4.0, l'arborescence "10.4-transitional" sera gelée à partir du 1er août 2006. Seule l'arborescence "10.4" sera gérée à partir de cette date.</p>
<p>Si la commande "fink --version" a pour résultat "0.8.1.cvs" ou "0.8.1.rsync", vous n'avez rien à faire.</p>
<p>Comme nous l'avons déjà écrit <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/news/#2006-07-01%20July%20is%20%22Fink%20Update%20Month%22">précédemment</a>, il y a deux façcons de passer à l'arborescence "10.4".</p>
<p>Le moyen le plus simple est de supprimer l'installation de Fink et d'en récréer une nouvelle en utilisant l'installeur 0.8.1 disponible sur la <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/download">page de téléchargement</a>.</p>
<p>Un autre moyen consiste à télécharger le <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/fink/scripts-10.4-update-0.4.tar.gz?download">script de mise à jour</a> et de lire les instructions dans le fichier README pour mettre à jour l'installation existante sans la supprimer. Cette méthode reconstruit l'installation Fink à partir du source et met à jour toute l'installation. Notez que le processus peut prendre un certain temps selon l'installation.</p>
<p>Nous avons reçu des rapports très encourageants sur l'utilisation du script ; de nombreux utilisateurs sont déjà passés à la nouvelle arborescence. Si vous rencontrez des problèmes, veuillez en faire part sur les <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/lists">listes de discussions</a>.
