      <p>The Fink project was started in the waning days of December 2000 by
Christoph Pfisterer, using the "public beta" release of Mac OS X.
Within a year, versions 10.0 and 10.1 of OS X had been released, and
Fink usage took off.  Our founder chrisp stepped away from the project
in November 2001, and the community took over.</p>
<p>The Fink community is the heart of Fink, involving both package maintainers
and Fink users, as well as the small core team which tries to keep the
overall system in good shape.  The success of this community in keeping
Fink viable and active over ten years is really quite remarkable!  Let's
all join together to keep Fink going for a long time to come.</p>
<p>How long?  In the memorable words of Buzz Lightyear: To Infinity
and Beyond!</p>

      and APPLE-SA-2010-10-20-2 Java for Mac OS X 10.5 Update 8 )

Fink is ready to be used on Snow Leopard (OS X v. 10.6).  Users will
need to choose between a 32-bit version of fink and a 64-bit version of fink
for 10.6.
The 32-bit version has more packages available at the present time, but
the 64-bit version represents the future direction for OS X and for fink;
individual users must make this decision on their own.  It will not
be possible to "upgrade" from 32-bit to 64-bit (or vice versa), without
completely reinstalling fink.
</p><p>
At the moment, two methods are available for installing Fink on Snow Leopard.
A binary installer is not available, so it is important to
first install XCode from the Optional Installs folder on the Snow
Leopard disk.
Users wanting the 64-bit version, or users upgrading directly from 10.4 or
earlier, must bootstrap fink from the distribution tarball (version
0.29.9 or later), available at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/fink/files/fink/0.29.9/fink-0.29.9.tar.gz/download">sourceforge.net</a>; installation instructions are
<a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/download/srcdist.php">here</a>.
On the other hand, users can upgrade directly from
10.5 to the 32-bit version, following the instructions below.
(One warning: users who have installed a development version of fink
from CVS rather than a released version may encounter trouble; please
downgrade your fink to a released version, and remove stray .deb files
of higher versions, before beginning.)
</p><p>
To upgrade, follow a four step process.
Step 1: edit the file /sw/etc/fink.conf,
adding a line to it which reads NoAutoIndex: true  (You may
need to use sudo to obtain the correct permissions to edit
this file.)  Step 2: 
run the command fink reinstall fink in
order to tell fink that you are now on 10.6.  (If you encounter a message
about package database corruption, run fink index -f and
try this step again.)  Step 3: 
run the command fink update
fink to get the latest fink for 10.6.  Step 4: run the command
fink install perl588-core to replace the version of perl
which Apple changed during the OS X upgrade, in case you have 
fink packages which depend on it.
</p><p>After the upgrade, you may wish to run fink configure
to do some cleanup.
</p><p>Almost all of the packages in fink's stable tree will compile on
10.6, but be warned that only a fraction of the 10.5 packages are currently
available for 10.6.  In the near future, fink's package database will be
updated to include information about packages for 10.6; you can check there
to see if your favorite package is ready.

The Fink Core Group announces two new members: Alexander Hansen (akh)
and Augusto Devegili (monipol), both of whom have been very active
in fink.  Please join us in welcoming the new members!
</p><p>
The Group also announces that Christian Schaffner has stepped down,
returning to "ordinary member" status.  We thank Christian for his help
on the team over the past several years.

Members of the Fink project are working hard to provide user support,

release.  More volunteers are always needed, so please consider
getting involved at some level!

The Fink project is no longer able to offer support for users of Fink
on Mac OS X 10.3. In reality there has been very little support for
some time, so this announcement simply formalizes that fact.
</p><p>
This means that there will not be any further updates, not even
security updates, for Mac OS X 10.3 users. Their existing
installations will continue to work, but the software that is
installed will not be updated.
</p><p>
We believe that the majority of our users are using Mac OS X 10.4 or
10.5 and hope that this does not inconvenience too many people.

The massive GNOME update which has been in process for
many months was merged into fink's unstable tree.  This is well
tested, and updates by users appear to be going fairly smoothly.
</p><p>
We are now merging the gnome update into the stable tree.  Because
we have been unable to test the dependencies of these new packages in
the stable tree in advance, users can expect the "stable" tree to be
"not so stable" during the next few weeks, while the bugs get worked
out.
</p><p>
If you are eager to start using this massive gnome update immediately,
we suggest that you switch to the unstable tree.  If not, we suggest
that you hold off running "fink selfupdate" for a while (perhaps a
week or two) until things have again stabilized.</p>

A new (binary) Fink release for OS X 10.5 (Leopard) is 
<a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/download/index.php">available</a>
 today: version 0.9.0, which can be installed on either Intel or PowerPC
hardware.
The release includes source files, binary packages, and  Fink
installers for both kinds of hardware.
</p>
      <p>
Users who have already installed Fink on Leopard from source, who now wish
to switch to the binary distribution, may do so as follows.  First,
run fink selfupdate to update to the latest version of the
fink package manager.  Next, run fink configure, and be sure
to change your choice about using the binary distribution from No
to yes.  Finally, run fink scanpackages to activate the binary
distribution.
</p>
<p>Update, 2008-07-11: If you use the binary installer, you
should run fink selfupdate after installation.</p>

Every large open source project has to face the problem of distribution and Fink is no different. We want you to get all the files you need to build your favourite application as quickly as possible. A mirror close to your location is a first step to achieving that. 
</p>
		<p>
We are actively working on building a reliable distribution infrastructure consisting of mirrors sponsored by universities and corporations. 
Recently our list of mirrors had to be shortened considerably and we need your help to improve its level of quality again.
</p>
	<p>
Are you a student? Are you a professor? Do you run a Data Center? Are you a developer with free time to spare? Even if you cannot say yes to any of those questions you still might be able to help.
All the relevant information on how to run and sponsor a mirror can be found on the <a href="http://wiki.finkproject.org/index.php/Fink:FinkMirrors">FinkWiki</a>.
For specific questions you can <a href="mailto:fink-core-private@lists.sourceforge.net">contact us</a> directly.
We are looking for mirrors all over the world, but specifically in these countries:</p>
United StatesJapanGermanyFranceUnited KingdomCanadaItalySpainSwitzerlandAustralia
	<p>
We would like to take this opportunity to thank those who are already providing Fink with mirrors. Without your continued support Fink would not be able to provide the level of service it currently does. Thank you!
