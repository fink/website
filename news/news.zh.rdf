      <p>Our user services have been restored. On Oct 28th the Web site and
      some of the mirrors (rsync, source files, binary distribution) were
      restored, and on Oct 30th all of our main rsync mirrors were operational.
      Once again, we apologise for the inconvenience. Thanks for your patience

Fink is ready to be used on Snow Leopard (OS X v. 10.6).  Users will
need to choose between a 32-bit version of fink and a 64-bit version of fink
for 10.6.
The 32-bit version has more packages available at the present time, but
the 64-bit version represents the future direction for OS X and for fink;
individual users must make this decision on their own.  It will not
be possible to "upgrade" from 32-bit to 64-bit (or vice versa), without
completely reinstalling fink.
</p><p>
At the moment, two methods are available for installing Fink on Snow Leopard.
A binary installer is not available, so it is important to
first install XCode from the Optional Installs folder on the Snow
Leopard disk.
Users wanting the 64-bit version, or users upgrading directly from 10.4 or
earlier, must bootstrap fink from the distribution tarball (version
0.29.9 or later), available at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/fink/files/fink/0.29.9/fink-0.29.9.tar.gz/download">sourceforge.net</a>; installation instructions are
<a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/download/srcdist.php">here</a>.
On the other hand, users can upgrade directly from
10.5 to the 32-bit version, following the instructions below.
(One warning: users who have installed a development version of fink
from CVS rather than a released version may encounter trouble; please
downgrade your fink to a released version, and remove stray .deb files
of higher versions, before beginning.)
</p><p>
To upgrade, follow a four step process.
Step 1: edit the file /sw/etc/fink.conf,
adding a line to it which reads NoAutoIndex: true  (You may
need to use sudo to obtain the correct permissions to edit
this file.)  Step 2: 
run the command fink reinstall fink in
order to tell fink that you are now on 10.6.  (If you encounter a message
about package database corruption, run fink index -f and
try this step again.)  Step 3: 
run the command fink update
fink to get the latest fink for 10.6.  Step 4: run the command
fink install perl588-core to replace the version of perl
which Apple changed during the OS X upgrade, in case you have 
fink packages which depend on it.
</p><p>After the upgrade, you may wish to run fink configure
to do some cleanup.
</p><p>Almost all of the packages in fink's stable tree will compile on
10.6, but be warned that only a fraction of the 10.5 packages are currently
available for 10.6.  In the near future, fink's package database will be
updated to include information about packages for 10.6; you can check there
to see if your favorite package is ready.

The Fink Core Group announces two new members: Alexander Hansen (akh)
and Augusto Devegili (monipol), both of whom have been very active
in fink.  Please join us in welcoming the new members!
</p><p>
The Group also announces that Christian Schaffner has stepped down,
returning to "ordinary member" status.  We thank Christian for his help
on the team over the past several years.
</p><p>
Members of the Fink project are working hard to provide user support,
to keep Fink up to date, and to prepare for the upcoming Snow Leopard
release.  More volunteers are always needed, so please consider
getting involved at some level!

The Fink project is no longer able to offer support for users of Fink
on Mac OS X 10.3. In reality there has been very little support for
some time, so this announcement simply formalizes that fact.
</p><p>
This means that there will not be any further updates, not even
security updates, for Mac OS X 10.3 users. Their existing
installations will continue to work, but the software that is
installed will not be updated.
</p><p>
We believe that the majority of our users are using Mac OS X 10.4 or
10.5 and hope that this does not inconvenience too many people.

The massive GNOME update which has been in process for
many months was merged into fink's unstable tree.  This is well
tested, and updates by users appear to be going fairly smoothly.
</p><p>
We are now merging the gnome update into the stable tree.  Because
we have been unable to test the dependencies of these new packages in
the stable tree in advance, users can expect the "stable" tree to be
"not so stable" during the next few weeks, while the bugs get worked
out.
</p><p>
If you are eager to start using this massive gnome update immediately,
we suggest that you switch to the unstable tree.  If not, we suggest
that you hold off running "fink selfupdate" for a while (perhaps a
week or two) until things have again stabilized.</p>

A new (binary) Fink release for OS X 10.5 (Leopard) is 
<a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/download/index.php">available</a>
 today: version 0.9.0, which can be installed on either Intel or PowerPC
hardware.
The release includes source files, binary packages, and  Fink
installers for both kinds of hardware.
</p>
      <p>
Users who have already installed Fink on Leopard from source, who now wish
to switch to the binary distribution, may do so as follows.  First,
run fink selfupdate to update to the latest version of the
fink package manager.  Next, run fink configure, and be sure
to change your choice about using the binary distribution from No
to yes.  Finally, run fink scanpackages to activate the binary
distribution.
</p>
<p>Update, 2008-07-11: If you use the binary installer, you
should run fink selfupdate after installation.</p>

Every large open source project has to face the problem of distribution and Fink is no different. We want you to get all the files you need to build your favourite application as quickly as possible. A mirror close to your location is a first step to achieving that. 
</p>
		<p>
We are actively working on building a reliable distribution infrastructure consisting of mirrors sponsored by universities and corporations. 
Recently our list of mirrors had to be shortened considerably and we need your help to improve its level of quality again.
</p>
	<p>
Are you a student? Are you a professor? Do you run a Data Center? Are you a developer with free time to spare? Even if you cannot say yes to any of those questions you still might be able to help.
All the relevant information on how to run and sponsor a mirror can be found on the <a href="http://wiki.finkproject.org/index.php/Fink:FinkMirrors">FinkWiki</a>.
For specific questions you can <a href="mailto:fink-core-private@lists.sourceforge.net">contact us</a> directly.
We are looking for mirrors all over the world, but specifically in these countries:</p>
United StatesJapanGermanyFranceUnited KingdomCanadaItalySpainSwitzerlandAustralia
	<p>
We would like to take this opportunity to thank those who are already providing Fink with mirrors. Without your continued support Fink would not be able to provide the level of service it currently does. Thank you!

<p>Some users of fink's unstable tree are having sporadic difficulties
at the end of building large packages, getting reports like
tar: File changed as we read it which causes the .deb file
not to be built.
</p><p>
The fink team is currently studying this problem to determine a permanent
fix.  For the time being, users experiencing this problem can work around
it by issuing the command fink install tar-1.15.1-14.  It
may be necessary to issue that command after each fink update-all
command, as well.
</p><p>Once the fink team has determined how to solve this problem 
permanently, another announcement will be made here.
</p>
<p> Update: 16 March 2007:  The new version of fink's 
dpkg package resolves this problem.  Unstable users can
now run the update commands normally.

<p> Update: 21 August 2006:  The server has been restored.</p>
	<p> 
The server which hosts four important
fink services (the rsync update, the binary distribution, the "master mirror" 
of source files, and the package database) is down at the moment.  We are
hoping that the server will be restored as early as Monday, August 21,
but are providing these workarounds for use during the period of outage.
</p><p>
To update fink, you must either select an rsync mirror other than the
primary one (see the next paragraph), or use the command
fink selfupdate-cvs.  You only need to give this command
once; subsequent updates will continue to be performed using CVS.
When the server is restored, you can revert to rsync updating by means
of the command fink selfupdate-rsync.
</p><p>
To work around the lack of the binary distribution, and the "master mirror"
of source files, run the command fink configure.  You should
accept the default answers to all of the questions, except the following:
when asked "Should Fink try to download pre-compiled packages from 
the binary distribution if available?" answer "no" (to disable the binary
distribution); when asked if you want to change the mirror settings,
answer "yes", and then you will be asked "What mirror order should fink use 
when downloading sources?".  The answer is "2: Search Master Mirrors last"
(to disable the automatic attempts to use the master mirror server).
Finally, if you have decided to stick with rsync for updates, when asked to
"Choose a mirror for 'RSync SelfUpdate'" you should choose one other than
rsync://master.us.finkmirrors.net/finkinfo/.  Unfortunately, other choices
might not be available to you if you are in the U.S.
</p><p>
Finally, to use the package database during the outage, you can connect
to <a href="http://lists.finkproject.org/pdb">this backup copy of the
package database</a> which is a few weeks out of date.

      <description>
			<p>
				The "10.4-transitional" tree was created as an interim solution to the issues of
				incompatibilities between binaries made using GCC 3.3 (the default Mac OS X 10.3
				compiler) and GCC 4.0 (the default Mac OS X 10.4 compiler).  Now that the work to
				move Fink to using GCC 4.0 is essentially finished, we will be stopping official
				support of the "10.4-transitional" tree in favor of the "10.4" tree as of August
				1st, 2006.
			</p>
			<p>You should not need to do anything if "fink --version" prints "0.8.1.cvs" or "0.8.1.rsync".</p>
			<p>
				As we mentioned <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/news/#2006-07-01%20July%20is%20%22Fink%20Update%20Month%22">previously</a>,
				there are 2 ways to make the switch to the supported "10.4" tree.
			</p>
			<p>
				The simplest way is to remove your Fink installation by deleting it and
				installing fresh using the 0.8.1 installer available from the <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/download">download page</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Alternately, to preserve your Fink installation, download the
				<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/fink/scripts-10.4-update-0.4.tar.gz?download">upgrade script</a>
				and read the README for instructions on how to upgrade your existing installation in-place.
				This will re-build your Fink installation from source, upgrading everything in the process.
				Be warned, it can take a lot of time, depending on your fink installation!
			</p>
			<p>
				Feedback on the upgrade script has been very positive; many users have already
				made the switch.  If you have problems, please feel free to mail your issues to
				the <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/lists">discussion lists</a>.
			</p>

<p> Update: 2 June 2007.  Due to changes to the behavior of sudo on 10.4.9, the update script needs a bit of assistance.  Switching to a superuser prompt first via sudo -s will suffice.</p>
