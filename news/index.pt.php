  <p>The Fink Project has released fink-0.45.6. This is a quick release to fix a bug introduced in fink-0.45.5 (issue #240).</p>
  <p>This release does not yet support macOS 11 (Big Sur) or macOS 12 (Monterey). Support for those two releases is coming soon.</p>
 <a name="2021-11-03%20fink-0.45.4%20released"><span class="news-date">2021-11-03: </span><span class="news-headline">fink-0.45.4 released</span></a><?php gray_line(); ?>
  <p>The Fink Project has released fink-0.45.4. This is a minor upgrade to support XQuartz 2.8.</p>
  <p>This release does not yet support macOS 11 (Big Sur) or macOS 12 (Monterey). Support for those two releases is coming soon.</p>
 <a name="2021-03-06%20fink-0.45.3%20released"><span class="news-date">2021-03-06: </span><span class="news-headline">fink-0.45.3 released</span></a><?php gray_line(); ?>
  <p>The Fink Project has released fink-0.45.3. This is a minor behavioral fix for an issue introduced in 0.45.2. With this release, the default prefix for new installs is reverted to <code>/sw</code> for all macOS versions from 10.14 and earlier. Newer releases still default to <code>/opt/sw</code>. This will allow installs on macOS 10.14 and earlier to continue to use any available binary distributions. There are no other functional changes in this release compared to fink-0.45.2.</p>
  <p>This release does not yet support macOS 11 (Big Sur).</p>
 <a name="2020-10-02%20fink-0.45.2%20released"><span class="news-date">2020-10-02: </span><span class="news-headline">fink-0.45.2 released</span></a><?php gray_line(); ?>
  <p>The Fink Project has released fink-0.45.2. This release provides support for all macOS releases up to and including 10.15.7. Most importantly, it changes the default install path location to <code>/opt/sw</code> for all supported macOS releases. This release also fixes bootstrapping problems when installing on macOS 10.15 with Xcode12. Run <code>fink selfupdate</code> to install the latest version. This release does not need any special preparation apart from those listed below if upgrading to macOS 10.15 from an earlier macOS release.</p>
  <p>This release does not yet support macOS 11 (Big Sur).</p>

  <p>The Fink Project has released fink-0.45.1. This release provides support for all macOS releases up to and including 10.15.4, as well as support for users running the zsh shell. Run <code>fink selfupdate</code> to install the latest version. This release does not need any special preparation apart from those listed below if upgrading to macOS 10.15 from an earlier macOS release.</p>

  <p>If upgrading to macOS 10.15 (Catalina) from an earlier macOS release, your existing Fink install will cease to work if installed outside <code>/opt</code> (such as to the previous default <code>/sw</code>) and must be reinstalled from scratch using Fink release 0.45.0 or later.</p>
  <p>The old Fink install is archived into <code>/Users/Shared/Relocated Items</code>. It's possible to manually recover downloaded source archives and configuration files from there to use in a new Fink install. However, it's not possible to reuse built .deb packages because they hardcode the original path that contained Fink.</p>
  <p>Upgrade and installation hints if existing Fink install is outside <code>/opt</code>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If doing a fresh Fink install on any macOS version, install Fink into <code>/opt/sw</code>.</li>
    <li>If you haven't yet updated to macOS 10.15, run this command to capture the list of your currently installed packages: <code>for i in `/bin/ls -1 /sw/var/lib/dpkg/info/*.list`; do basename -s .list $i &gt;&gt; ~/my_fink_packages.txt; done</code>.</li>
    <li>If you have already updated to macOS 10.15 but had Fink installed somewhere outside <code>/opt</code> before your system upgrade, use the above command (with modified path to the "Relocated Items" location as necessary) to capture the packages you previously had installed on your older macOS release. For example: <code>for i in `/bin/ls -1 "/Users/Shared/Relocated Items/sw/var/lib/dpkg/info/"*.list`; do basename -s .list $i &gt;&gt; ~/my_fink_packages.txt; done</code></li>
    <li>Once you have captured your list of previous packages, upgraded to macOS 10.15, and installed Fink into <code>/opt</code>, run the following command to batch build and reinstall your previous Fink packages: <code>cat ~/my_fink_packages.txt | xargs fink reinstall</code>. Note that some packages do not exist on macOS 10.15, so you might need to hand edit the file <code>my_fink_packages.txt</code> to remove the missing packages before trying to reinstall.</li>
  </ul>
 <a name="2019-10-02%2010.15%20(Catalina)%20and%20Xcode11%20information"><span class="news-date">2019-10-02: </span><span class="news-headline">10.15 (Catalina) and Xcode11 information</span></a><?php gray_line(); ?>
  <p>Fink 0.45.0 and up support the upcoming 10.15 release, but there are some important things to note:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Apple locked down the <code>/ (root)</code> directory where Fink normally installs (in <code>/sw</code> by default), so existing Fink installs may become read-only upon updating to 10.15.</li>
    <li>Xcode11 introduces some known breakages (with no known fixes at this time) to important packages like gcc, so not everything will build yet.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Once macOS 10.15 is officially released, we suggest waiting to upgrade until we know how the system will treat existing installs and we can determine the best upgrade path.</p>
  <p>For anyone installing Fink for the first time (on 10.15beta or an earlier macOS version), we now recommend using <code>/opt/sw</code> as the install location, since that's known to work. The next Fink release after macOS 10.15 is out will use <code>/opt/sw</code> as the default install location.</p>
  <p>Xcode11 is known to currently break building the gccX and several other important packages. If possible (especially 10.14 users), hold off on upgrading to Xcode11 unless you need something specific from it. If you do upgrade to Xcode11, make sure that the Command Line Tools are also upgraded to version 11 for your macOS release.</p>

  <p>The Fink Project has released fink-0.45.0. This release provides support for macOS 10.14.5 and up, including preliminary support for macOS 10.15beta. This release also provides full support for .app bundles in APFS volumes.</p>
  <p>If your system is still on macOS 10.14.4 or earlier:</p>

  <p>If you have updated to High Sierra before updating fink, your <code>fink</code> command 
  won't be able to function any more.  Fortunately, a workaround is now available.</p>
  <p>1) Download an updated <a href="http://bindist.finkproject.org/10.13/dists/stable/main/binary-darwin-x86_64/base/fink_0.42.0-121_darwin-x86_64.deb">fink</a>.</p>

  <p>Because of a recent Sourceforge outage, we haven't been able to do a proper <code>fink</code> 
  release that supports High Sierra.  However, since the <code>fink</code> source on 
  Github isn't affected by this, it is possible to get a pre-release version out of our
  <code>git</code> repository and install that.</p>
  <p>The following sequence of steps should allow you to update your Fink installation
  on 10.9 (Mavericks) or later for High Sierra.  10.8 (Mountain Lion) or earlier 
  have no supported upgrade path.</p>
  <p>0) Don't update your OS yet!</p>
  <p>1) Download a copy of the 
  <a href="https://github.com/fink/fink/archive/master.zip">repository archive</a> and
  uncompress it if your browser doesn't do that automatically.</p>
  <p>2) Open a Terminal window and change to the resulting <code>fink-master</code> directory
  e.g. <code>cd ~/Downloads/fink-master</code> .</p>
  <p>3) Run the command <code>sudo ./inject.pl</code> to update <code>fink</code>.</p>
  <p>4) Update your OS to High Sierra.</p>
  <p>5) Open a Terminal window and run <code>fink reinstall fink</code> to reset your distribution.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>For new installs on High Sierra:</p>
  <p>1) Install the Xcode 9 command-line tools by running <code>sudo xcode-select --install</code> 
  in a Terminal window.</p>
  <p>2) Install the latest JDK from Oracle, e.g. by running <code>javac</code> in a Terminal 
  window.</p>
  <p>3) Follow steps 1-2) from the upgrade instructions above.</p>
  <p>4) Run <code>sudo ./bootstrap</code></p>
  <p>5) The default bootstrap operation will error out at the end for the time being, until 
  an official High Sierra binary distribution has been uploaded.  Go ahead and run <code>
  /sw/bin/pathsetup.sh</code> as usual, however.</p>

  to restore the requirement that the /usr/X11R6 convenience symlink be present for
  the <code>x11*</code> virtual packages to be active.
  </p>
  <p>
  It also downgrades building libraries with flat namespace from a fatal validation
  error to a warning, since some packages require such a build.  There are a number
  of additional validation enhancements as well.  Check the commit logs on fink's

  official support for OS X 10.9.2, fixes the bootstrap operation when Xcode.app isn't
  present, and makes x86_64 the default architecture for 10.6 bootstraps.

  <p><code>fink-0.34.4</code> was released on 25 September, 2012.  This release adds diagnostics to make
  sure that the permissions of directories that <code>fink</code> uses when building packages are appropriate.
  Additionally, OS X versions 10.7.5 and 10.8.2 are recognized.</p>
 <a name="2012-07-25%20Mountain%20Lion%20released"><span class="news-date">2012-07-25: </span><span class="news-headline">Mountain Lion released</span></a><?php gray_line(); ?>
   <p>Mountain Lion is now available to the general public.  Ideally, users should update
 to <code>fink-0.34.0</code> or later before updating their OS.  In addition, Xcode 4.4 
 (or at least its command line tools) is required--it can be installed under Lion, but 
 there is a separate version of the Command Line Tools for Mountain Lion, so make sure
 to install those.  Use </p><p><code>fink list xcode</code></p><p>to verify that you have the
 Xcode 4.4 command-line tools installed, and that Fink knows where your Xcode.app is.
 If the CLI tools are missing or not for Xcode 4.4, reinstall them, e.g. via the Xcode 
 Preferences.  If <code>fink</code> isn't finding your Xcode.app, use</p>
 <p><code>sudo xcode-select -switch /path/to/Xcode.app</code></p>
 <p>to make sure that your system's tools are pointing to the right place.  Also run</p>
 <p><code>sudo xcodebuild -license</code></p><p>to make sure that the Xcode license is accepted
 globally on your system, especially for fink's build user.</p>
 <p>Once you have updated the OS, use</p>
 <p><code>fink reinstall fink</code></p><p>to point it to the 10.8 distribution, and run</p>
 <p><code>fink install perl5123-core</code></p><p>to make sure any Perl modules you have
 from Lion will still work.</p>
 <p>If you updated the OS first,
  and have an earlier version of <code>fink</code> which doesn't know about Mountain Lion, you
  have probably found that it doesn't work.  To work around this issue, do the 
  following: (1) download an updated copy of 
  <a href="https://raw.github.com/fink/fink/master/perlmod/Fink/Services.pm">
  Services.pm</a>, (2) move the downloaded file into /sw/lib/perl5/Fink, such as
  via</p><p><code>sudo mv /path/to/Services.pm /sw/lib/perl5/Fink</code></p><p>; 
  (change <code>/sw</code> and <code>/path/to</code> to match 
  your particular setup); (3) run</p><p><code>fink selfupdate</code></p><p>, which should
  download and install <code>fink-0.34.0</code>; (4) use </p><p><code>fink reinstall fink</code></p>
  <p>to ensure that <code>fink</code> is pointing at the 10.8 distribution, 
  and (5) install <code>perl5123-core</code>
  as above.</p>
  <p><b>Addendum, 2012-07-26:</b>  It appears that the OS update wipes out the
  users that Fink creates (but not the groups).  After following the steps above, you should
  (1) Run</p><p><code>fink configure</code></p><p> to set the Fink build user back up, and 
  (2) use </p><p><code>fink list -it passwd | cut -f2 | xargs fink reinstall</code></p><p> to reinstall
  the various <code>passwd*</code> packages and their users.</p>

   (i.e. most packages) if certain <code>su</code> or <code>sudo</code> options were 
   chosen.  In addition, packages now log the md5 sums of all of their files for diagnostic

   <p><code>fink-0.33.0</code> was released on 6 June, 2012.  This release introduces some new
    features:</p>
   <p>Starting with this version of <code>fink</code>, packages will be built as an unprivileged
   user by default, which prevents the build process from installing files in the rest of the
   filesystem. (Prior to <code>fink-0.33.0</code> we relied on maintainers to test their packages
   using this method).  Users may find that some packages don't build in this mode, so we appreciate
   feedback, as always, to help us find and correct problems.</p>
   <p>In addition, we have added some additional options for maintainers in this Fink version.
   <b>/sw/Library/Python</b> has been added to the list of valid directories in a package, to
   provide a unified location to install modules built against a built-in Python.  There is
   now an <code>xcode.app</code> virtual package for packages that use <code>xcodebuild</code>
   to BuildDepend upon.  Its version is the version of Xcode.app.  The <code>xcode</code>
   virtual package has always been based on the presence of the command-line tools, and now its
   version is the version of those.  Note that <code>xcode</code> and <code>xcode.app</code>
   are the same for Xcodes prior to 4.3.</p>

    <code>fink-0.32.6</code> was released on 14 April, 2012.  This release introduces
    a new package description field, <code>BuildAsNobody: false</code>, to mark packages which
    cannot built using <code>fink --build-as-nobody</code>.  Currently, this does not
    have any effect, but in <code>fink-0.33.0</code> and later we will begin building packages
    as an unprivileged user by default, and this field will allow packages to be built
    as root.

      10.6 wouldn't be allowed to bootstrap, even though this is a fully supported
      configuration.  It also provides a more robust scheme to report on the
      Xcode version in error messages than in prior <code>fink</code> versions.
      Finally OS 10.7.1 is recognized as a supported OS version.</p>
      <p>It is expected that the package will be added to 10.4/stable shortly.</p>

      <p>OS X 10.7 "Lion" was released on July 20, 2011.  We want to let Fink
      users know what to expect if updating.</p>
<p>First, the <code>fink</code> 
program itself will not run  on a system which has
been upgraded to Lion, so it is not possible currently to update a Fink
installation in place.  However, is possible to use the
<code>dpkg</code> program to extract a list of the Fink packages
which had been installed under 10.6, so that they can be reinstalled
under 10.7.  Use</p>
<p><code>dpkg --get-selections | cut -f1 &gt; fink_packages.txt</code></p>
<p>to extract the packages, and</p>
<p><code>cat fink_packages.txt | xargs fink install</code></p>
<p>once you have installed Fink for 10.7.</p>
<p>To upgrade Fink after upgrading to Lion, one will have to bootstrap
Fink again, using a tarball for <code>fink-0.31.0</code> or later.</p>
<p>Second, due to lots of changes under the hood, there currently are many fewer
Fink packages which build under 10.7 as opposed to 10.6.
Thus, even if you've extracted a list of Fink packages which had
been installed under 10.6, some of them may not yet be installable under
10.7.  We are currently creating a database showing which packages
can be successfully installed under 10.7, and work is ongoing to add packages.</p>
<p>10.7 introduces several drastic changes to how the system works. While this may
cause a slight delay in full Fink functionality in the short term, it will
make Fink work better in the future.</p>

      <p>The Fink project was started in the waning days of December 2000 by
Christoph Pfisterer, using the "public beta" release of Mac OS X.
Within a year, versions 10.0 and 10.1 of OS X had been released, and
Fink usage took off.  Our founder chrisp stepped away from the project
in November 2001, and the community took over.</p>
<p>The Fink community is the heart of Fink, involving both package maintainers
and Fink users, as well as the small core team which tries to keep the
overall system in good shape.  The success of this community in keeping
Fink viable and active over ten years is really quite remarkable!  Let's
all join together to keep Fink going for a long time to come.</p>

	  <p>Estamos com problemas no servidor e por conseguinte o site e a
	  distribuição oficial de binários estão fora do ar, e os servidores rsync
	  não estão atualizando. Enquanto resolvemos os problemas, você pode:</p>
	  <ul>
		<li>(Web site) Usar o <a href="http://fink.thetis.ig42.org">http://fink.thetis.ig42.org</a>
		caso necessite das informações do site;</li>

		<li>(selfupdate) Se você usa rsync como seu método de selfupdate então
		edite o arquivo <code>/sw/etc/fink.conf</code> e substitua a linha que
		começa com <code>Mirror-rsync</code> por <code>Mirror-rsync:
		rsync://fink.gecko.ig42.org/finkinfo/</code></li>

		<li>(arquivos fontes) Edite o arquivo <code>/sw/etc/fink.conf</code> e
		substitua a linha que começa com <code>Mirror-master</code> por
		<code>Mirror-master: http://fink-dist.gecko.ig42.org</code></li>

		<li>(bindist) Edite o arquivo <code>/sw/etc/fink.conf</code> e
		substitua a linha que começa com <code>Mirror-apt:</code> por
		<code>Mirror-apt: http://fink-bindist.gecko.ig42.org</code></li>

		<li>(bindist) Edite o arquivo <code>/sw/etc/apt/sources.list</code> e
		substitua <code>http://bindist.finkmirrors.net/bindist</code> por

	<a name="2009-08-28%20Fink%20no%20OS%20X%2010.6"><span class="news-date">2009-08-28: </span><span class="news-headline">Fink no OS X 10.6</span></a><?php gray_line(); ?>
      <p>O Fink está pronto para ser usado no Snow Leopard (OS X 10.6). Os
      usuários precisam escolher dentre a versão do Fink de 32 bits e a de 64
      bits para o 10.6. A versão de 32 bits possui mais pacotes disponíveis no
      momento mas a versão de 64 bits representa a direção futura tanto do OS X
      quanto do Fink; os usuários precisam fazer a escolha por conta própria.
      <b>Não</b> será possível fazer uma atualização de 32 bits para 64 bits
      (ou vice-versa) sem que o Fink seja completamente reinstalado.</p>
      <p>No presente momento, dois métodos estão disponíveis para instalar o
      Fink no Snow Leopard. Um instalador binário não está disponível,
      portanto é importante <b>instalar primeiro o Xcode da pasta Optional
      Installs no disco do Snow Leopard.</b> Usuários que queiram a versão de
      64 bits ou que estejam atualizando diretamente do OS X 10.4 ou anteriores
      devem instalar o Fink do zero a partir da tarball de distribuição (versão
      0.29.9 ou posteriores) disponível no <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/fink/files/fink/0.29.9/fink-0.29.9.tar.gz/download">sourceforge.net</a>;
      as instruções de instalação estão <a href="<?php print $root; ?>download/srcdist.php">aqui</a>. Por outro lado, os usuários
      podem atualizar diretamente do OS X 10.5 para a versão de 32 bits
      seguindo as instruções abaixo. (Aviso: usuários que tenham instalado uma
      versão de desenvolvimento do Fink a partir do CVS no lugar de uma versão
      efetivamente lançada podem encontrar problemas; por favor, antes de
      começar, mude para uma versão oficialmente lançada e remova os arquivos
      .deb que possuam versões maiores.)</p>
      <p>Para fazer a atualização, siga os quatro passos a seguir. <b>Passo
      1:</b> edite o arquivo <code>/sw/etc/fink.conf</code> e adicione uma
      linha contendo <code>NoAutoIndex: true</code> (talvez você tenha que usar
      o <code>sudo</code> para obter as permissões corretas para editar o
      arquivo.) <b>Passo 2:</b> execute o comando <code>fink reinstall
      fink</code> para dizer ao Fink que agora você está no OS X 10.6.
      (Caso encontre uma mensagem sobre corrupção do banco de dados de pacotes,
      execute o comando <code>fink index -f</code> e tente este passo
      novamente.) <b>Passo 3:</b> execute o comando <code>fink update
      fink</code> para obter a última versão do Fink para o OS X 10.6.
      <b>Passo 4:</b> execute o comando <code>fink install
      perl588-core</code> para substituir a versão do Perl que foi alterada
      pela Apple durante a atualização do OS X caso você possua pacotes que
      dependam dele.</p>
      <p>Depois da atualização, talvez você queira executar o comando
      <code>fink configure</code> para fazer uma limpeza.</p>
      <p>Quase todos os pacotes do Fink na árvore stable vão compilar no OS X
      10.6 mas esteja ciente de que apenas uma fração dos pacotes do 10.5 estão
      disponíveis para o 10.6. Em um futuro próximo, o banco de dados de
      pacotes do Fink será atualizado para que inclua informações sobre pacotes
      para o 10.6; você poderá consultá-lo para verificar se seus pacotes
      prediletos estão disponíveis.</p>
    <a name="2009-07-25%20Mudan%C3%A7as%20no%20Grupo%20Central"><span class="news-date">2009-07-25: </span><span class="news-headline">Mudanças no Grupo Central</span></a><?php gray_line(); ?>
      <p>O Grupo Central do Fink anuncia dois novos membros: Alexander Hansen
      (<b>akh</b>) e Augusto Devegili (<b>monipol</b>), tendo ambos estado
      bastante ativos no projeto. Una-se a nós e dê as boas-vindas aos novos
      membros!</p>
      <p>A equipe também anuncia que Christian Schaeffner retirou-se do grupo,
      voltando ao status de colaborador regular. Agradecemos ao Christian por
      sua ajuda na equipe nos últimos anos.</p>
      <p>Membros do projeto Fink estão trabalhando arduamente para prover
      suporte ao usuário, manter o Fink atualizado, e preparar para o futuro
      lançamento do Snow Leopard. Sempre precisamos de mais voluntários,
      portanto cogite contribuir de alguma forma!</p>
    <a name="2008-07-23%20Fim%20do%20suporte%20ao%2010.3."><span class="news-date">2008-07-23: </span><span class="news-headline">Fim do suporte ao 10.3.</span></a><?php gray_line(); ?>
      <p>O projeto Fink não pode mais oferecer suporte a usuários do Fink no
      Mac OS X 10.3. Na verdade tem havido pouco suporte por algum tempo então
      este anúncio simplesmente formaliza esse fato.</p>
      <p>Isto significa que não haverá atualizações futuras, nem mesmo de
      segurança, para usuários do Mac OS X 10.3. Suas instalações atuais
      continuarão a funcionar mas o software que estiver instalado não será
      atualizado.</p>
      <p>Acreditamos que a maioria dos nossos usuários estejam usando Mac OS X
      10.4 ou 10.5 e esperiamos que esta decisão não seja inconveniente a
      muitas pessoas.</p>
    <a name="2008-07-17%20Migra%C3%A7%C3%A3o%20em%20passa%20de%20pacotes."><span class="news-date">2008-07-17: </span><span class="news-headline">Migração em passa de pacotes.</span></a><?php gray_line(); ?>
      <p>A atualização massiva do GNOME que esteve em andamento por várias
      meses foi incorporada à árvore unstable. Os pacotes foram bem testados e
      as atualizações feitas por usuários aparentam estar ocorrendo
      tranquilamente.</p>
      <p>Estamos agora incorporando a atualização do GNOME à árvore stable.
      Devido ao fato de não termos podido testar antecipadamente as
      dependências desses novos pacotes, os usuários podem esperar que a árvore
      stable não esteja tão estável durante as próximas semanas, enquanto os
      erros serão corrigidos.</p>
      <p>Se você está ansioso para usar imediatamente essa atualização massiva
      do GNOME, sugerimos que mude para a árvore unstable. Caso não queira,
      sugerimos que suspenda a execução de "fink selfupdate" por algum tempo
      (talvez uma semana ou duas) até que tudo esteja estabilizado
      novamente.</p>
    <a name="2008-06-26%20Nova%20vers%C3%A3o%20do%20Fink."><span class="news-date">2008-06-26: </span><span class="news-headline">Nova versão do Fink.</span></a><?php gray_line(); ?>
      <p>Uma nova versão (binária) do Fink para o OS X 10.5 (Leopard) está
      <a href="<?php print $root; ?>download/index.php">disponível</a> a partir de hoje:
      versão 0.9.0, a qual pode ser instalada em hardware Intel ou PowerPC.
      Esta versão inclui códigos fontes, pacotes de binários e instaladores do
      Fink para ambos os tipos de hardware.</p>
      <p>Usuários que já tenham instalado o Fink no Leopard a partir do código
      fonte e que queiram mudar para a distribuição de binários podem fazer o
      seguinte. Em primeiro lugar, execute <code>fink selfupdate</code> para
      atualizar para a última versão do gerenciador de pacotes fink. Em
      seguida, execute <code>fink configure</code> e assegure-se de
      <b>mudar</b> sua escolha sobre usar a distribuição de binários de Não
      para Sim. Finalmente, execute <code>fink scanpackages</code> para ativar
      a distribuição de binários.</p>
      <p><b>Atualização, 2008-07-11:</b> se você usa o instalador binário,
      você precisa executar <code>fink selfupdate</code> após a instalação.</p>
