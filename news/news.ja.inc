  <p>The Fink Project has released fink-0.45.3. This is a minor behavioral fix for an issue introduced in 0.45.2. With this release, the default prefix for new installs is reverted to <code>/sw</code> for all macOS versions from 10.14 and earlier. Newer releases still default to <code>/opt/sw</code>. This will allow installs on macOS 10.14 and earlier to continue to use any available binary distributions. There are no other functional changes in this release compared to fink-0.45.2.</p>
  <p>This release does not yet support macOS 11 (Big Sur).</p>

Most importantly, it changes the default install path location to <code>/opt/sw</code> for all supported macOS releases. This release also fixes bootstrapping problems when installing on macOS 10.15 with Xcode12. Run <code>fink selfupdate</code> to install the latest version. This release does not need any special preparation apart from those listed below if upgrading to macOS 10.15 from an earlier macOS release.</p>
