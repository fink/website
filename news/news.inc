Thanks to Baba Yoshihiko Fink has now taken the necessary steps to allow for internalisation efforts. 
The improved infrastructure allow us to display a multilingual web-site to our visitors from all over the world. 
</p>
<p>
This also means that we need volunteers. The Fink web-site needs to be translated into the language of your choice. 
A translation into Japanese is being worked on and the translation into French has been taken over by Michele Garoche. 
Which language are you willing to translate?
</p>
<p>
If you are willing to become a member of the internationalisation team or wish to provide acknowledgement on 
the web-site feel free to join the new mailing-list.
You can do so by going to our <a href="<?php print $root; ?>lists/index.php">mailing-lists page</a>. The full announcement on the existing 
mailing lists can be read <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.os.apple.fink.devel/7554">here</a>.

	<p>
If you previously had Java 1.4.1 and the Java SDK installed, the new
Java 1.4.2 update from apple will upgrade the Java runtime to 1.4.2,
but will <b>remove</b> the previous 1.4.1 Java runtime and
SDK <b>without</b> upgrading the JDK.  To build Java packages in Fink
you will need to <a href="http://connect.apple.com/">go to
connect.apple.com and download the Java 1.4.2 SDK</a> (free
registration required).

	<p>
Many of the binary files for 10.3 have been updated, eliminating problems
with qt and kde, among others.  To access the updated files, bring your
index of binary files up-to-date by running the
command <code>sudo apt-get update</code> .  After this, you can use
apt-get, dselect or FinkCommander to install binary files as usual.
