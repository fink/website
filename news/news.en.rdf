			<p>The Fink Project has seen the future, and it is flat and portable.</p>
			<p>Effective 1 May 2010, we are going to cease work on our Mac efforts, and 
switch to development for the iPad, as well as the iPhone and iPod Touch.</p>
			<p>The Fink distributions for Mac users on 10.4, 10.5, and 10.6 will still be 
available, but the project will no longer provide updates.</p>
			<p>Thank you for your support over the years, and we hope you will pick up an
iPad when it is available in your area so that you can continue to enjoy Fink on a large screen.</p>

      some of the mirrors (rsync, source files, binary distribution) were
      restored, and on Oct 30th all of our main rsync mirrors were operational.
      Once again, we apologise for the inconvenience. Thanks for your patience

Fink is ready to be used on Snow Leopard (OS X v. 10.6).  Users will
need to choose between a 32-bit version of fink and a 64-bit version of fink
for 10.6.
The 32-bit version has more packages available at the present time, but
the 64-bit version represents the future direction for OS X and for fink;
individual users must make this decision on their own.  It will not
be possible to "upgrade" from 32-bit to 64-bit (or vice versa), without
completely reinstalling fink.
</p><p>
At the moment, two methods are available for installing Fink on Snow Leopard.
A binary installer is not available, so it is important to
first install XCode from the Optional Installs folder on the Snow
Leopard disk.
Users wanting the 64-bit version, or users upgrading directly from 10.4 or
earlier, must bootstrap fink from the distribution tarball (version
0.29.9 or later), available at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/fink/files/fink/0.29.9/fink-0.29.9.tar.gz/download">sourceforge.net</a>; installation instructions are
<a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/download/srcdist.php">here</a>.
On the other hand, users can upgrade directly from
10.5 to the 32-bit version, following the instructions below.
(One warning: users who have installed a development version of fink
from CVS rather than a released version may encounter trouble; please
downgrade your fink to a released version, and remove stray .deb files
of higher versions, before beginning.)
</p><p>
To upgrade, follow a four step process.
Step 1: edit the file /sw/etc/fink.conf,
adding a line to it which reads NoAutoIndex: true  (You may
need to use sudo to obtain the correct permissions to edit
this file.)  Step 2: 
run the command fink reinstall fink in
order to tell fink that you are now on 10.6.  (If you encounter a message
about package database corruption, run fink index -f and
try this step again.)  Step 3: 
run the command fink update
fink to get the latest fink for 10.6.  Step 4: run the command
fink install perl588-core to replace the version of perl
which Apple changed during the OS X upgrade, in case you have 
fink packages which depend on it.
</p><p>After the upgrade, you may wish to run fink configure
to do some cleanup.
</p><p>Almost all of the packages in fink's stable tree will compile on
10.6, but be warned that only a fraction of the 10.5 packages are currently
available for 10.6.  In the near future, fink's package database will be
updated to include information about packages for 10.6; you can check there
to see if your favorite package is ready.

The Fink Core Group announces two new members: Alexander Hansen (akh)
and Augusto Devegili (monipol), both of whom have been very active
in fink.  Please join us in welcoming the new members!
</p><p>
The Group also announces that Christian Schaffner has stepped down,
returning to "ordinary member" status.  We thank Christian for his help
on the team over the past several years.
</p><p>
Members of the Fink project are working hard to provide user support,
to keep Fink up to date, and to prepare for the upcoming Snow Leopard
release.  More volunteers are always needed, so please consider
getting involved at some level!

The Fink project is no longer able to offer support for users of Fink
on Mac OS X 10.3. In reality there has been very little support for
some time, so this announcement simply formalizes that fact.
</p><p>
This means that there will not be any further updates, not even
security updates, for Mac OS X 10.3 users. Their existing
installations will continue to work, but the software that is
installed will not be updated.
</p><p>
We believe that the majority of our users are using Mac OS X 10.4 or
10.5 and hope that this does not inconvenience too many people.

The massive GNOME update which has been in process for
many months was merged into fink's unstable tree.  This is well
tested, and updates by users appear to be going fairly smoothly.
</p><p>
We are now merging the gnome update into the stable tree.  Because
we have been unable to test the dependencies of these new packages in
the stable tree in advance, users can expect the "stable" tree to be
"not so stable" during the next few weeks, while the bugs get worked
out.
</p><p>
If you are eager to start using this massive gnome update immediately,
we suggest that you switch to the unstable tree.  If not, we suggest
that you hold off running "fink selfupdate" for a while (perhaps a
week or two) until things have again stabilized.</p>

A new (binary) Fink release for OS X 10.5 (Leopard) is 
<a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/download/index.php">available</a>
 today: version 0.9.0, which can be installed on either Intel or PowerPC
hardware.
The release includes source files, binary packages, and  Fink
installers for both kinds of hardware.
</p>
      <p>
Users who have already installed Fink on Leopard from source, who now wish
to switch to the binary distribution, may do so as follows.  First,
run fink selfupdate to update to the latest version of the
fink package manager.  Next, run fink configure, and be sure
to change your choice about using the binary distribution from No
to yes.  Finally, run fink scanpackages to activate the binary
distribution.
</p>
<p>Update, 2008-07-11: If you use the binary installer, you
should run fink selfupdate after installation.</p>

Every large open source project has to face the problem of distribution and Fink is no different. We want you to get all the files you need to build your favourite application as quickly as possible. A mirror close to your location is a first step to achieving that. 
</p>
        <p>
We are actively working on building a reliable distribution infrastructure consisting of mirrors sponsored by universities and corporations. 
Recently our list of mirrors had to be shortened considerably and we need your help to improve its level of quality again.
</p>
    <p>
Are you a student? Are you a professor? Do you run a Data Center? Are you a developer with free time to spare? Even if you cannot say yes to any of those questions you still might be able to help.
All the relevant information on how to run and sponsor a mirror can be found on the <a href="http://wiki.finkproject.org/index.php/Fink:FinkMirrors">FinkWiki</a>.
For specific questions you can <a href="mailto:fink-core-private@lists.sourceforge.net">contact us</a> directly.
We are looking for mirrors all over the world, but specifically in these countries:</p>
United StatesJapanGermanyFranceUnited KingdomCanadaItalySpainSwitzerlandAustralia
    <p>
We would like to take this opportunity to thank those who are already providing Fink with mirrors. Without your continued support Fink would not be able to provide the level of service it currently does. Thank you!

<p>Users who want to update their Leopard X11 installation should make sure to download a <a href="http://xquartz.macosforge.org/downloads/Xquartz-1.3.0-apple-fink.bz2">Fink-friendly update to Xquartz</a>.  Users who have already applied the X11-2.1.0.1.pkg from macosxforge.org must download the Fink-compatible Xquartz for Fink to work properly.  (Note: there is an X11-2.1.1.pkg release pending which will remove the need to patch your Xquartz.  If you install X11 2.1.1 or later, do not apply the Xquartz patch.)</p>
<p>Update, 2007-12-11: The X11 2.1.1 release <a href="http://trac.macosforge.org/projects/xquartz/wiki/Releases">is now available on the Xquartz release page</a>.  Users who have already applied the X11-2.1.0.1.pkg and/or the patched Xquartz-1.3.0-apple-fink file from macosxforge.org should upgrade to 2.1.1 or greater for Fink to work properly.  This release supercedes all previous releases, including the fink-specific Xquartz.</p>

    <p>The Package Database web interface is presently down pending hardware and software upgrades. We are working on fixing the server as soon as possible. Sorry for any inconvenience.</p>
    <p>Update, 2007-12-10: The Package Database is up and running again, with a few new features, including RSS support in the package browser.</p>

    <p>The Fink Project announces initial support for Mac OS X Leopard (10.5).</p>
    <p>10.5 users who are starting a new Fink tree will need to do this via bootstrap, until a binary distribution gets generated.  Download fink-0.27.8 <a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/fink/fink-0.27.8.tar.gz">here</a>.</p>
    <p>The 10.4-&gt;10.5 update can be accomplished by running fink selfupdate to get fink-0.27.8 .  If you're doing this on 10.5, make sure that you have Xcode 3.0 installed.  After 10.5 is installed, run fink reinstall fink.</p>
    <p>A direct 10.3-&gt;10.5 upgrade path isn't ready yet.  If you're impatient to get going, you'll need to download the fink-0.27.8 tarball and bootstrap a new Fink tree as above.</p>
    <p>Update, 2007-10-29:  Users who have updated from 10.4 to 10.5 should note that using fink cleanup to remove .deb files will remove all of them.  This issue should be resolved in the next update.</p>
    <p>Update, 2007-11-03:  fink-0.27.8 or later should solve the above issue as well as a couple of others that have come up.</p>

<p>Some users of fink's unstable tree are having sporadic difficulties
at the end of building large packages, getting reports like
tar: File changed as we read it which causes the .deb file
not to be built.
</p><p>
The fink team is currently studying this problem to determine a permanent
fix.  For the time being, users experiencing this problem can work around
it by issuing the command fink install tar-1.15.1-14.  It
may be necessary to issue that command after each fink update-all
command, as well.
</p><p>Once the fink team has determined how to solve this problem 
permanently, another announcement will be made here.
</p>
<p> Update, 16 March 2007:  The new version of fink's 
dpkg package resolves this problem.  Unstable users can
now run the update commands normally.

<p> Update, 21 August 2006:  The server has been restored.</p>
    <p> 
The server which hosts four important
fink services (the rsync update, the binary distribution, the "master mirror" 
of source files, and the package database) is down at the moment.  We are
hoping that the server will be restored as early as Monday, August 21,
but are providing these workarounds for use during the period of outage.
</p><p>
To update fink, you must either select an rsync mirror other than the
primary one (see the next paragraph), or use the command
fink selfupdate-cvs.  You only need to give this command
once; subsequent updates will continue to be performed using CVS.
When the server is restored, you can revert to rsync updating by means
of the command fink selfupdate-rsync.
</p><p>
To work around the lack of the binary distribution, and the "master mirror"
of source files, run the command fink configure.  You should
accept the default answers to all of the questions, except the following:
when asked "Should Fink try to download pre-compiled packages from 
the binary distribution if available?" answer "no" (to disable the binary
distribution); when asked if you want to change the mirror settings,
answer "yes", and then you will be asked "What mirror order should fink use 
when downloading sources?".  The answer is "2: Search Master Mirrors last"
(to disable the automatic attempts to use the master mirror server).
Finally, if you have decided to stick with rsync for updates, when asked to
"Choose a mirror for 'RSync SelfUpdate'" you should choose one other than
rsync://master.us.finkmirrors.net/finkinfo/.  Unfortunately, other choices
might not be available to you if you are in the U.S.
</p><p>
Finally, to use the package database during the outage, you can connect
to <a href="http://lists.finkproject.org/pdb">this backup copy of the
package database</a> which is a few weeks out of date.
