  to restore the requirement that the /usr/X11R6 convenience symlink be present for
  the <code>x11*</code> virtual packages to be active.
  </p>
  <p>
  It also downgrades building libraries with flat namespace from a fatal validation
  error to a warning, since some packages require such a build.  There are a number
  of additional validation enhancements as well.  Check the commit logs on fink's

  These <code>fink</code> releases contain fixes for Java detection on 10.6 if older
  versions of Apple's Java SDK are installed.  <code>fink-0.37.0</code> officially 
  recognizes OS 10.9.3.  In addition, Fink's compiler wrappers are 
  now installed directly by the fink package to make for easier modifications.
  </p>
  <p>
  <code>fink-0.36.5</code> marks the end of 10.6 support by the Fink Project.  Users
  who want package updates should contact the maintainers of the respective packages.

  <p>
  <code>fink-0.36.4</code> was released on 6 April, 2014.
  This <code>fink</code> release restores the use of an official binary distribution by
  default on 10.8 and 10.9 (if distributions are created for 10.6 and 10.7
  those will be supported, too).  In addition, it works around the multiple
  build failures introduced by Xcode 5.1 on 10.8 and 10.9. This release also includes 
  official support for OS X 10.9.2, fixes the bootstrap operation when Xcode.app isn't
  present, and makes x86_64 the default architecture for 10.6 bootstraps.
  </p>
  <p>Users are encouraged to run <code>fink selfupdate</code> to install this version of
  fink, particularly in view of the Xcode 5.1 build issues.</p>

  problems with installing a Perl module, use <code>fink rebuild</code>
  on it.

  <p>
  In addition, the bootstrap  script now validates whether the Mavericks 
  command-line build tools are installed on that OS version, and prevents 
  folks from bootstrapping with the wrong tools.

which had been installed under 10.6, so that they can be reinstalled
under 10.7.  Use</p>
<p><code>dpkg --get-selections | cut -f1 &gt; fink_packages.txt</code></p>
<p>to extract the packages, and</p>
<p><code>cat fink_packages.txt | xargs fink install</code></p>
<p>once you have installed Fink for 10.7.</p>
<p>To upgrade Fink after upgrading to Lion, one will have to bootstrap
Fink again, using a tarball for <code>fink-0.31.0</code> or later.</p>
<p>Second, due to lots of changes under the hood, there currently are many fewer
Fink packages which build under 10.7 as opposed to 10.6.
Thus, even if you've extracted a list of Fink packages which had
been installed under 10.6, some of them may not yet be installable under
10.7.  We are currently creating a database showing which packages
can be successfully installed under 10.7, and work is ongoing to add packages.</p>
<p>10.7 introduces several drastic changes to how the system works. While this may
cause a slight delay in full Fink functionality in the short term, it will
make Fink work better in the future.</p>

      <p>Apple has announced that OS X 10.7 "Lion" will be released 
in July.  We want to let Fink users know what to expect when Lion is 
released.</p>
<p>First, the <code>fink</code>

been upgraded to Lion.  However, it will be possible to use the
<code>dpkg</code> program to extract a list of the Fink packages

<p>once you have installed Fink for 10.7.</p>
<p>(To upgrade fink after upgrading to Lion, one will have to bootstrap
fink again, using a new version of fink which will be released shortly
after Lion has been released.  Watch this space for an announcement.)</p>
<p>Second, due to lots of changes under the hood, there will initially
be many fewer Fink packages which work under 10.7 as opposed to 10.6.
Thus, even if you've extracted a list of Fink packages which had
been installed under 10.6, some of them may not yet be installable under
10.7.  We are currently creating a database showing which packages
can be successfully installed under 10.7, but that database
may not be complete prior to the release of Lion.</p>
<p>10.7 introduces several drastic changes to how the system works. While this may
cause a slight delay in full Fink functionality in the short term, it will

      <p>The Fink project was started in the waning days of December 2000 by
Christoph Pfisterer, using the "public beta" release of Mac OS X.
Within a year, versions 10.0 and 10.1 of OS X had been released, and
Fink usage took off.  Our founder chrisp stepped away from the project
in November 2001, and the community took over.</p>
<p>The Fink community is the heart of Fink, involving both package maintainers
and Fink users, as well as the small core team which tries to keep the
overall system in good shape.  The success of this community in keeping
Fink viable and active over ten years is really quite remarkable!  Let's
all join together to keep Fink going for a long time to come.</p>

      <p>
Fink is ready to be used on Snow Leopard (OS X v. 10.6).  Users will
need to choose between a 32-bit version of fink and a 64-bit version of fink
for 10.6.
The 32-bit version has more packages available at the present time, but
the 64-bit version represents the future direction for OS X and for fink;
individual users must make this decision on their own.  It will <b>not</b>
be possible to "upgrade" from 32-bit to 64-bit (or vice versa), without
completely reinstalling fink.
</p><p>
At the moment, two methods are available for installing Fink on Snow Leopard.
A binary installer is not available, so it is important to
<b>first install XCode from the Optional Installs folder on the Snow
Leopard disk.</b>
Users wanting the 64-bit version, or users upgrading directly from 10.4 or
earlier, must bootstrap fink from the distribution tarball (version
0.29.9 or later), available at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/fink/files/fink/0.29.9/fink-0.29.9.tar.gz/download">sourceforge.net</a>; installation instructions are
<a href="<?php print $root; ?>download/srcdist.php">here</a>.
On the other hand, users can upgrade directly from
10.5 to the 32-bit version, following the instructions below.
(One warning: users who have installed a development version of fink
from CVS rather than a released version may encounter trouble; please
downgrade your fink to a released version, and remove stray .deb files
of higher versions, before beginning.)
</p><p>
To upgrade, follow a four step process.
<b>Step 1:</b> edit the file <code>/sw/etc/fink.conf</code>,
adding a line to it which reads <code>NoAutoIndex: true</code>  (You may
need to use <code>sudo</code> to obtain the correct permissions to edit
this file.)  <b>Step 2:</b> 
run the command <code>fink reinstall fink</code> in
order to tell fink that you are now on 10.6.  (If you encounter a message
about package database corruption, run <code>fink index -f</code> and
try this step again.)  <b>Step 3:</b> 
run the command <code>fink update
fink</code> to get the latest fink for 10.6.  <b>Step 4:</b> run the command
<code>fink install perl588-core</code> to replace the version of perl
which Apple changed during the OS X upgrade, in case you have 
fink packages which depend on it.
</p><p>After the upgrade, you may wish to run <code>fink configure</code>
to do some cleanup.
</p><p>Almost all of the packages in fink's stable tree will compile on
10.6, but be warned that only a fraction of the 10.5 packages are currently
available for 10.6.  In the near future, fink's package database will be
updated to include information about packages for 10.6; you can check there
to see if your favorite package is ready.

The Fink Core Group announces two new members: Alexander Hansen (<b>akh</b>)
and Augusto Devegili (<b>monipol</b>), both of whom have been very active
in fink.  Please join us in welcoming the new members!
</p><p>
The Group also announces that Christian Schaffner has stepped down,
returning to "ordinary member" status.  We thank Christian for his help
on the team over the past several years.
</p><p>
Members of the Fink project are working hard to provide user support,
to keep Fink up to date, and to prepare for the upcoming Snow Leopard
release.  More volunteers are always needed, so please consider
getting involved at some level!

      <p>
The Fink project is no longer able to offer support for users of Fink
on Mac OS X 10.3. In reality there has been very little support for
some time, so this announcement simply formalizes that fact.
</p><p>
This means that there will not be any further updates, not even
security updates, for Mac OS X 10.3 users. Their existing
installations will continue to work, but the software that is
installed will not be updated.
</p><p>
We believe that the majority of our users are using Mac OS X 10.4 or
10.5 and hope that this does not inconvenience too many people.

      <p>
The massive GNOME update which has been in process for
many months was merged into fink's unstable tree.  This is well
tested, and updates by users appear to be going fairly smoothly.
</p><p>
We are now merging the gnome update into the stable tree.  Because
we have been unable to test the dependencies of these new packages in
the stable tree in advance, users can expect the "stable" tree to be
"not so stable" during the next few weeks, while the bugs get worked
out.
</p><p>
If you are eager to start using this massive gnome update immediately,
we suggest that you switch to the unstable tree.  If not, we suggest
that you hold off running "fink selfupdate" for a while (perhaps a
week or two) until things have again stabilized.</p>

      <p>
A new (binary) Fink release for OS X 10.5 (Leopard) is 
<a href="<?php print $root; ?>download/index.php">available</a>
 today: version 0.9.0, which can be installed on either Intel or PowerPC
hardware.
The release includes source files, binary packages, and  Fink
installers for both kinds of hardware.
</p>
      <p>
Users who have already installed Fink on Leopard from source, who now wish
to switch to the binary distribution, may do so as follows.  First,
run <code>fink selfupdate</code> to update to the latest version of the
fink package manager.  Next, run <code>fink configure</code>, and be sure
to <b>change</b> your choice about using the binary distribution from No
to yes.  Finally, run <code>fink scanpackages</code> to activate the binary
distribution.
</p>

		<p>
Every large open source project has to face the problem of distribution and Fink is no different. We want you to get all the files you need to build your favourite application as quickly as possible. A mirror close to your location is a first step to achieving that. 
</p>
		<p>
We are actively working on building a reliable distribution infrastructure consisting of mirrors sponsored by universities and corporations. 
Recently our list of mirrors had to be shortened considerably and we need your <b>help</b> to improve its level of quality again.
</p>
	<p>
Are you a student? Are you a professor? Do you run a Data Center? Are you a developer with free time to spare? Even if you cannot say yes to any of those questions you still might be able to help.
All the relevant information on how to run and sponsor a mirror can be found on the <a href="http://wiki.finkproject.org/index.php/Fink:FinkMirrors">FinkWiki</a>.
For specific questions you can <a href="mailto:fink-core-private@lists.sourceforge.net">contact us</a> directly.
We are looking for mirrors all over the world, but specifically in these countries:</p>
<ul><li>United States</li><li>Japan</li><li>Germany</li><li>France</li><li>United Kingdom</li><li>Canada</li><li>Italy</li><li>Spain</li><li>Switzerland</li><li>Australia</li></ul>
	<p>
We would like to take this opportunity to thank those who are already providing Fink with mirrors. Without your continued support Fink would not be able to provide the level of service it currently does. Thank you!

    <p>Le projet Fink annonce le commencement du support pour Leopard (Mac OS X 10.5).</p>
<p>Les utilisateurs de 10.5 démarrant une nouvelle arborescence Fink devront le faire via bootstrap, tant qu'une distribution binaire ne sera pas disponible. <a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/fink/fink-0.27.7.tar.gz">Téléchargez la version 0.27.7 de Fink</a>.</p>
<p>La mise à jour de 10.4 vers 10.5 pour Fink peut s'effectuer en exécutant la commande <code>fink selfupdate</code> pour installer fink-0.27.7. Si vous êtes déjà sous 10.5, vérifiez d'abord que Xcode 3.0 est installé. Une fois 10.5 installé, exécutez ensuite <code>fink reinstall fink</code>.</p>
<p>La mise à jour de 10.3 vers 10.5 n'est pas encore prête. Si vous êtes impatient(e), vous devrez alors démarrer une nouvelle arborescence via bootstrap avec <code>fink-0.27.7</code>.</p>
<p><b>Actualisé le 29 octobre:</b> Attention, pour les utilisateurs qui installent la mise à jour Leopard, exécuter la commande <code>fink cleanup</code> supprimera <b>l'ensemble</b> de vos fichiers .deb. La prochaine version de Fink corrigera ce problème.</p>

Pour l'instant, les utilisateurs confrontés à cette situtation peuvent la contourner en exécutant la commande <code>fink install tar-1.15.1-14</code>.

<p><b>Mise à jour du 21/08/2006 </b> : le serveur est de nouveau accessible.</p>
<p>Le serveur qui héberge quatre services fink important (mise à jour via rsync, distribution binaire, "serveur maître" des fichiers sources et base de données des paquets) est inaccessible en ce moment. Nous espérons qu'il sera de nouveau fonctionnel lundi 21 août. Voici les solutions provisoires à votre disposition pendant l'indisponibilité du serveur.</p>
<p>Pour mettre à jours fink, vous devez soit choisir un miroir rsync différent du miroir primaire (voir le paragraphe suivant, soit utilisez la commmande <code>fink selfupdate-cvs</code>. Cette commande ne doit être utilisée qu'une seule fois ; les mises à jour suivantes se feront automatiquement via CVS. Quand le serveur sera de nouveau fonctionnel, vous pourrez revenir à la mise à jour via rsync en exécutant la commande <code>fink selfupdate-rsync</code>.</p>
<p>Pour pallier l'absence de distribution binaire et celle du "serveur primaire" des fichiers sources, exécutez la commande <code>fink configure</code>. Acceptez les réponses par défaut à toutes les questions, sauf à celles-ci: "Fink doit-il télécharger les paquets pré-compilés de la distribution binaire s'ils existent ?" (en anglais "Should Fink try to download pre-compiled packages from the binary distribution if available?"). Répondez alors "no" (en français "non") pour désactiver la distribution binaire. "Voulez-vous changer les miroirs ?" (en anglais "Do you want the change the mirror settings?"). Répondez "yes" (en français "oui"). "Dans quel ordre les miroirs doivent-ils être utilisés pour le téléchargement des sources ?" (en anglais ("What mirror order should fink use when downloading sources?". Répondez "2: Search Master Mirrors last" (en français "2 : Rechercher sur les miroirs maîtres en dernier lieu") pour désactiver l'utilisation automatique du serveur miroir maître). Enfin, si vous décidez de continuer à faire les mises à jour via rsync, vous devez choisir un autre miroir que rsync://master.us.finkmirrors.net/finkinfo/ en réponse à la question "Choisissez un miroir pour 'les mises à jour rsync'" (en anglais "Choose a mirror for 'RSync SelfUpdate'". Malheureusement, il se peut qu'aucun autre choix ne vous soit possible si vous habitez aux États-Unis.</p>
<p>Enfin, pour utiliser la base de données des paquets pendant la période d'indisponibilité du serveur, connectez-vous à <a href="http://pdb.finkproject.org/pdb/">cette copie de sauvegarde de la base de données des paquets</a>. Sachez, toutefois, qu'elle a quelques semaines de retard.</p>

<p><b> Update: 2 June 2007.</b>  Due to changes to the behavior of <code>sudo</code> on 10.4.9, the update script needs a bit of assistance.  Switching to a superuser prompt first via <code>sudo -s</code> will suffice.</p>

<p>L'arborescence "10.4-transitional" fut créée pour résoudre de façon provisoire les incompatibilités entre binaires construits à partir de GCC 3.3 (le compilateur par défaut du système Mac OS X 10.3) et GCC 4.0 (le compilateur par défaut du système Mac OS X 10.4). À présent que Fink utilise GCC 4.0, l'arborescence "10.4-transitional" sera gelée à partir du 1er août 2006. Seule l'arborescence "10.4" sera gérée à partir de cette date.</p>
<p><b>Si la commande "fink --version" a pour résultat "0.8.1.cvs" ou "0.8.1.rsync", vous n'avez rien à faire.</b></p>
<p>Comme nous l'avons déjà écrit <a href="<?php print $root; ?>news/#2006-07-01%20July%20is%20%22Fink%20Update%20Month%22">précédemment</a>, il y a deux façcons de passer à l'arborescence "10.4".</p>
<p>Le moyen le plus simple est de supprimer l'installation de Fink et d'en récréer une nouvelle en utilisant l'installeur 0.8.1 disponible sur la <a href="<?php print $root; ?>download">page de téléchargement</a>.</p>
<p>Un autre moyen consiste à télécharger le <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/fink/scripts-10.4-update-0.4.tar.gz?download">script de mise à jour</a> et de lire les instructions dans le fichier README pour mettre à jour l'installation existante sans la supprimer. Cette méthode reconstruit l'installation Fink à partir du source et met à jour toute l'installation. Notez que le processus peut prendre un certain temps selon l'installation.</p>
<p>Nous avons reçu des rapports très encourageants sur l'utilisation du script ; de nombreux utilisateurs sont déjà passés à la nouvelle arborescence. Si vous rencontrez des problèmes, veuillez en faire part sur les <a href="<?php print $root; ?>lists">listes de discussions</a>.

<p>Les utilisateurs de Fink sur machines PowerPc qui utilisent l'arborescence "10.4-transitional" doivent passer à l'arborescence "10.4". Nous avons prévu de geler l'arborescence 10.4-transitional à la fin du mois de Juillet.</p>
<p>Historique : le système Mac OS X 10.4 a introduit une nouvelle version du compilateur g++ (l'une des bêtes de somme de Fink). Cette version du compilateur produit du code incompatible avec les versions précédentes du compilateur. Dans l'arborescence 10.4-transitional, Fink mélange du code produit par le nouveau compilateur gcc-4.0 et du code produit par l'ancien compilateur g++-3.3. Cette stratégie a permis de dégager du temps pour rendre les paquets compatibles avec le compilateur g++-4.0. L'heure est maintenant venue de clore cette période transitoire et de ne plus utiliser que la nouvelle arborescence. Néanmoins, la mise à jour est compliquée du fait que tous les paquets qui utilisent ou fournissent des librairies g++ doivent être recompilés dans un certain ordre.</p>
<p>Si vous utilisez Mac OS X 10.4, vous pouvez déterminer si vous devez faire cette mise à jour en exécutant la commande <code>fink --version</code>. Si la version de distribution est la version "0.8.1.cvs" ou "0.8.1.rsync", vous <b>n'avez pas besoin</b> de faire la mise à jour. Mais si la version de distribution est la version "0.8.0.cvs" ou "0.8.0.rsync", vous <b>devez</b> effectuer la mise à jour comme décrit ci-dessous.</p>
<p>Certains utilisateurs préfèreront supprimer leur installation fink et réinstaller une nouvelle distribution avec l'installeur 0.8.1. D'autres préfèreront utiliser le <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/fink/scripts-10.4-update-0.4.tar.gz?download">paquet de mise à jour 10.4 (v. 0.4)</a> (environ 12 Mo), qui comprend des versions précompilées des paquets de base de fink ainsi qu'un script de mise à jour de l'installation existante. Voir les instructions détaillées dans le fichier README qui se trouve dans le répertoire 10.4-update après décompression du paquet.</p>
<p>Note : les utilisateurs de Fink qui passent du système Mac OS X 10.3 au système Mac OS X 10.4 peuvent utiliser les mêmes procédures : soit supprimer complètement leur installation de fink et réinstaller une nouvelle distribution, soit utiliser le paquet le mise à jour 10.4. Le script de mise à jour ne doit pas être exécuté avant d'avoir mis à jour Mac OS X.</p>
<a name="15/06/2006%20Nouvelle%20version%20de%20Fink"><span class="news-date">15/06/2006: </span><span class="news-headline">Nouvelle version de Fink</span></a><?php gray_line(); ?>
<p>Aujourd'hui, une nouvelle version de Fink pour Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) a été <a href="<?php print $root; ?>download/index.php">postée</a>. C'est la version 0.8.1 qui peut être installée soit sur architecture Intel, soit sur architecture PowerPC. Cette version inclut les fichiers sources, les paquets binaires et les installeurs Fink pour les deux types d'architecture.</p>
<p>Fink sur architecture Intel est toujours considéré comme étant en phase "bêta". Un grand nombre de paquets (en particulier les paquets de l'arborescence instable) soit ne compilent pas, soit compilent mais ne marchent pas. Nous travaillons à améliorer la situation.</p>
<p>Les utilisateurs de Fink sur architecture PowerPC qui utilisent déjà l'arborescence 10.4-transitional à partir de la distribution 0.8.0 peuvent mettre à jour Fink de deux manières différentes. Le processus de mise à jour n'est pas simple en raison des changements dans l'ABI des librairies g++; cela implique de recompiler de nombreuses librairies. La plupart des utilisateurs préfèreront sans supprimer leur installation de fink et repartir de zéro à partir de l'installeur 0.8.1. D'autres préfèreront utiliser le nouveau <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/fink/scripts-10.4-update-0.3.tar.gz?download">paquet de mise à jour pour 10.4 (v. 0.3)</a> (environ 12 Mo), qui inclut des versions précompilées des paquets de base de fink ainsi qu'un script qui tentera de mettre à jour l'installation de fink en place.</p>
<a name="10/05/2006%20Probl%C3%A8mes%20avec%20CVS"><span class="news-date">10/05/2006: </span><span class="news-headline">Problèmes avec CVS</span></a><?php gray_line(); ?>
<p>Comme la plupart des utilisateurs de Fink ont pu s'en rendre compte, l'accès au serveur CVS de Fink sur sourceforge.net ne fonctionne pas correctement depuis le 30 mars. L'accès CVS anonyme n'a pas été mis à jour depuis cette date et, depuis quelques jours, les développeurs ne peuvent, eux non plus, mettre à jour CVS par quelque moyen que ce soit.</p>
<p>Il semblerait que les intentions de l'équipe de sourceforge (brièvement expliquées dans la <a href="http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php%20docid=2352&amp;group_id=1">page de statut de leur site</a>) soient de ne pas réactiver les anciens serveurs CVS dans leur forme antérieure. Cela va conduire à des perturbations pour les utilisateurs de Fink, mais, à l'heure actuelle, nous ne savons pas quelle forme elles vont prendre.</p>
<p>Nous recommandons aux utilisateurs de Fink de passer à la méthode de mise à jour via 'rsync' (en exécutant la commande 'fink selfupdate-rsync'). Cela permettra au moins d'avoir une installation de Fink mise à jour jusqu'au 7 mai. Si  une mise à jour complète via CVS s'avère impossible par la suite avec la commande normale fink selfupdate, nous indiquerons ici comment effectuer la mise à jour lorsqu'elle sera disponible.</p>
<p>Mise à jour du 24/05/2006 : CVS fonctionne de nouveau. Les utilisateurs de la méthode de mise à jour via rsync obtiendront automatiquement les dernières mises à jour. Ceux qui utilisent la méthode de mise à jour via cvs et ne peuvent (ou ne veulent) passer à la méthode rsync doivent télécharger le fichier <code>fink-mirrors-0.24.15.2.tar.gz</code> situé sur la <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=17203&amp;package_id=69685">page de téléchargement du fichier sur Sourceforge</a>, décompresser ce fichier et exécuter la commande <code>./inject.pl</code> à partir du répertoire <code>fink-mirrors-0.24.15.2</code>. Ensuite, la commande <code>fink selfupdate</code> devrait fonctionner comme auparavant.</p>

<p>On a rapporté à l'équipe Fink des problèmes avec le programme <code>rsync</code>, programme qui a été modifié par la dernière mise à jour de sécurité d'Apple 2006-001. Certains utilisateurs ne peuvent plus exécuter <code>fink selfupdate</code> après la mise à jour de sécurité. La cause semble être un problème avec l'option <code>--delete</code> de <code>rsync</code>.</p>
<p>L'une des solutions est d'exécuter <code>fink install rsync</code> pour utiliser le paquet rsync de fink au lieu du programme d'Apple. Pour les utilisateurs qui ont besoin des fonctionnalités spécifiques du programme d'Apple (telle la gestion des attributs étendus), la solution est d'exécuter <code>fink selfupdate-cvs</code> pour passer à la mise à jour via cvs.</p>
<p>Mise à jour 13/03/2006 : le problème a été résolu par la mise à jour de sécurité 2006-002, <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=303453">comme indiqué dans la documentation d'Apple</a>.

<p>Une première version de Fink pour l'architecture Intel est maintenant prête. Il n'existe pas encore de paquets binaires, et tout n'est pas encore peaufiné, mais elle est utilisable pour ceux qui ont de la patience.</p>
<p>Pour l'installer, vous devez d'abord installer au minimum les paquets compilateur et SDK de Xcode. Ensuite vous devez télécharger le fichier <code>fink-0.24.14.tar.gz</code> à partir de <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=17203&amp;package_id=13043">la page de distribution de Fink sur SourceForge</a>, le décompresser et exécuter la commande <code>./bootstrap.sh</code>. Quand l'amorçage sera terminé, exécutez <code>fink selfupdate</code> ; vous obtiendrez ainsi les paquets actuellement disponibles.</p>
<p>Aux dernières nouvelles, il y avait environ 1 750 paquets dans l'arborescence "stable", mais 150 d'entre eux échouaient à la compilation. Quand tout sera vraiment stable, nous l'annoncerons ici.</p>
<a name="10/01/2006%20Fink%20est%20pr%C3%AAt%20pour%20XCode%202.2%20(mais%20par%20pour%20Intel)."><span class="news-date">10/01/2006: </span><span class="news-headline">Fink est prêt pour XCode 2.2 (mais par pour Intel).</span></a><?php gray_line(); ?>
<p>Fink est maintenant prêt pour XCode 2.2, à l'exception des paquets openoffice.org (nous espérons qu'ils fonctionneront de nouveau quand nous passerons à l'arborescence 10.4). Nous encourageons les utilisateurs à passer à la version 2.2 de XCode s'ils le désirent ; XCode 2.2 devra être installé quand l'arborescence 10.4 sera mise à disposition.</p>
<p>D'un autre côté et malgré l'annonce qu'Apple a faite aujourd'hui, Fink n'est pas prêt à tourner sur des processeurs Intel. L'équipe de Fink espère avoir une version prête pour Intel dans quelques semaines ; nous suggérons aux heureux bénéficiaires d'un nouvel iMac de ne pas y installer Fink tout de suite, mais d'attendre que la nouvelle version de Fink soit prête.</p>
<p>Les mainteneurs de paquets Fink doivent tenir compte du nouveau champ <code>Architecture</code>, dont l'usage est expliqué dans le guide d constructions de paquets.</p>

<p>L'équipe Fink a eu vent de problèmes de compilation avec XCode 2.2. Nous vous recommandons de vous abstenir de mettre à jour XCode tant que ces problèmes ne seront pas résolus.</p>
<p>Ceux qui ont déjà installé XCode 2.2 et ne souhaitent pas revenir à la version 2.1 sont cordialement invités à nous aider à trouver les paquets qui ne fonctionnent pas et à faire en sorte qu'ils marchent.</p>

<p>Trois nouvelles versions de Fink sont <a href="<?php print $root; ?>download/index.php">disponibles</a> aujourd'hui : la version 0.8.0 (pour Mac OS X 10.4), la version 0.7.2 (pour Mac OS X 10.3) et la version 0.6.4 (pour Mac OS X 10.2). Les trois versions comprennent les fichiers sources, les paquets binaires et un installeur Fink pour les nouveaux utilisateurs.</p>
<p>La nouvelle version pour Mac OS X 10.4 inclut tous les paquets "stable" actuellement disponibles sous forme source et sous forme binaire. C'est-à-dire 1 565 paquets, ce qui constitue plus de 80 % des 1 909 paquets disponibles dans la version pour Mac OS X 10.3. Les développeurs de Fink continuent à porter les paquets stables sur Tiger.</p>
<p>La nouvelle version pour Mac OS X 10.2 est la dernière version officielle pour ce système. Bien qu'il n'y aura plus de mises à jour fournies par l'équipe Fink - y compris de mises à jour de sécurité -, nous estimons que la version 0.6.4 devrait fonctionner tout à fait correctement pour quelques années encore.</p>
<p>Les utilisateurs qui passent de la version 10.3 à la version 10.4 par mise à jour n'ont qu'à exécuter <code>fink selfupdate</code>, suivi de <code>sudo /sw/lib/fink/postinstall.pl</code> (pour les personnes qui passent au système 10.4 pour la première fois), de <code>fink scanpackages</code> et de <code>sudo apt-get update</code>. Nous vous recommandons de ne pas utiliser l'amorçage pour le moment, car il ne fonctionne pas avec la nouvelle version 2.1 de Xcode d'Apple.</p>
<p>Note ajoutée le 19/06/2005 : si l'installeur binaire Fink-0.8.0 signale que le volume ne gère pas les liens symboliques, lancez l'Utilitaire de disque (situé dans le répertoire Utilitaires du dossier Applications), sélectionnez le volume en cause et cliquez sur "Réparez les autorisations du disque". L'installeur ne peut fonctionner que si vous avez des droits d'administrateur, assurez-vous donc que vous le faites tourner sous un utilisateur qui possèdent ces droits.</p>
<p>Note ajoutée le 30/06/2005 : pour éviter des problèmes avec d'anciens headers ou fichiers, nous recommandons aux personnes qui souhaitent construire les paquets à partir des sources de faire une installation propre de Xcode à l'aide du script <code>/Developer/Tools/uninstall-devtools.pl</code>. Il est préférable de le faire avant de mettre à jour le système.</p>

<li>Un installeur binaire sera disponible d'ici quelques semaines pour les utilisateurs de binaires. D'ici là, les nouveaux utilisateurs peuvent amorcer l'installation de la version 0.23.10 de fink, comme expliqué ci-dessous aux utilisateurs de la branche stable.</li>
<li>Nous recommandons aux utilisateurs de la branche stable de supprimer fink en utilisant la commande <code>sudo rm -Rf /sw</code>, puis d'amorcer l'installation de la version 0.23.10 de fink avec le fichier compressé <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=17203&amp;package_id=13043&amp;release_id=326600">fink-0.23.10.tar.gz</a>. Téléchargez ce fichier et décompressez-le via la commande <code>tar -xvzf fink-0.23.10.tar.gz</code>. Exécutez ensuite la commande <code>./bootstrap.sh</code> dans le répertoire <code>fink-0.23.10</code> nouvellement créé. Enfin, lancez la commande <code>fink selfupdate</code>.</li>
<li>Les utilisateurs de la branche instable peuvent faire la mise à jour via <code>fink selfupdate</code> si leur version de fink est inférieure à la version 0.24.6. Elle sera alors installée. Après passage à la version 10.4 de Mac OS X, vérifiez d'abord que vous avez la bonne version de fink en exécutant <code>fink --version</code>. Si la version est inférieure à 0.24.6, lancez <code>fink selfupdate</code>. Que vous ayez ou non exécuté la commande <code>fink selfupdate</code>, réinstallez ensuite le paquet fink via la commande <code>fink rebuild fink</code>, suivie de <code>fink selfupdate</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tous les paquets ne fonctionnent pas encore sous Mac OS X 10.4, mais la situation va s'améliorer au fil des semaines. La branche stable contient, à l'heure actuelle, nettement moins de paquets que sous Mac OS X 10.3, mais tous ceux qui sont présents devraient compiler sans problèmes.</p>
<p>Il reste bien sûr quelques petits défauts à corriger. Nous recommandons aux utilisateurs, dont le travail dépend du bon fonctionnement de certaines applications, de vérifier sur les listes de diffusion si les applications en question ont été testées avant de faire la mise à jour.</p>
<a name="20/11/2004%20Solution%20aux%20probl%C3%A8mes%20gcc"><span class="news-date">20/11/2004: </span><span class="news-headline">Solution aux problèmes gcc</span></a><?php gray_line(); ?>
<p>Apple a publié une mise à jour de gcc3 en novembre 2004 (November 2004 gcc3 updater). Elle est disponible sur connect.apple.com après enregistrement gratuit. Cette mise à jour résout les problèmes du compilateur gcc3 dans XCode 1.5. Si vous utilisez ce dernier, vous devez installer la mise à jour. Elle s'effectuera correctement, que vous ayez ou non installé précédemment la solution recommandée par Fink.</p>
<p>Remercions Apple d'avoir répondu à nos rapports sur ce sujet et d'avoir travaillé à la résolution de ce problème aussi rapidement que possible.</p>
<a name="15/10/2004%20R%C3%A9solution%20de%20probl%C3%A8mes%20concernant%20gcc"><span class="news-date">15/10/2004: </span><span class="news-headline">Résolution de problèmes concernant gcc</span></a><?php gray_line(); ?>
<p>Il s'avère que la version de gcc incluse dans XCode 1.5 produit des résultats incorrects avec du code C++ dans certains cas. Fink possède maintenant un mécanisme pour en avertir l'utilisateur et refusera bientôt d'utiliser cette version "vérolée" pour compiler les paquets qui présentent ce problème.</p>
<p>Si vous êtes déjà passé à la version 1.5 de XCode, vous trouverez une solution décrite <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.os.apple.fink.beginners/13580">ici</a> ou <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.os.apple.fink.beginners/14200">là</a>.</p>
<p>Si vous n'avez pas encore mis à jour XCode, il vous est conseillé de ne pas le faire tant que ce problème ne sera pas résolu.</p>
<a name="20/09/2004%20Fink%200.7.1%20est%20disponible"><span class="news-date">20/09/2004: </span><span class="news-headline">Fink 0.7.1 est disponible</span></a><?php gray_line(); ?>
<p>La dernière version de Fink, 0.7.1 (pour 10.3) est maintenant disponible sous forme de sources ou de binaires. Cette tourne sur les versions Panther (10.3) de Mac OS X. La version 0.6.3 reste disponible pour les utilisateurs des versions Jaguar (10.2) de Mac OS X.</p>
<p>Elle intégre diverses corrections du gestionnaire de paquets. De plus, de nombreux paquets, auparavant indisponibles sous forme binaire, ont été ajoutés, ce qui porte le total des binaires disponibles à 1650. Ils comprennent, en autres, les binaires de KDE 3.1.4 et ceux de GNOME 2.4.</p>
<p>Pour installer Fink pour la première fois, veuillez suivre les instructions données <a href="<?php print $root; ?>download/index.php?phpLang=fr">ici</a>. Pour mettre à jour Fink, servez-vous de la version installée sur votre système. Vous trouverez la liste des différences entre les versions 0.7.0 et 0.7.1 sur cette <a href="http://pdb.finkproject.org/pdb/compare.php?tree1=0.7.1-stable&amp;cmp=0&amp;tree2=0.7.0-stable&amp;splitoffs=on&amp;sort=name">page.</a></p>
<p>Si vous vous posez des questions ou rencontrez des difficultés, n'hésitez pas à vous servir des listes de diffusion de Fink. Vous en trouverez le détail <a href="<?php print $root; ?>lists/index.php?phpLang=fr">ici</a>.</p>
<p>Vérifiez que vous avez choisi le <b>bon installeur</b> pour votre plate-forme. Fink 0.6.3 n'est installable que sur Mac OS X 10.2.*, tandis que Fink 0.7.1 ne convient que pour Mac OS X 10.3.*.</p>
<p>L'équipe Fink remercie toutes les personnes sans lesquelles cette version n'aurait pas vu le jour : ses nombreux contributeurs, toutes les personnes qui apportent leur aide régulièrement ainsi que les développeurs. Nous remercions aussi notre communauté d'avoir téléchargé la version 0.7.0 précédente plus de 130 000 fois. Sans son soutien constant et ses conseils judicieux, Fink n'en serait pas là aujourd'hui.</p>

<p>Ces derniers jours, on nous a signalé que certains paquets de fink ne peuvent être compilés correctement avec XCode 1.5. Si vous n'avez pas encore effectué la mise à jour vers XCode 1.5, nous vous conseillons d'attendre pour le faire que ce problème soit résolu.</p>
<p>Si vous rencontrez des problèmes lors de la compilation d'un paquet sous XCode 1.5, alors que ce même paquet se compile correctement sous XCode 1.2, veuillez le signaler sur la liste de diffusion fink-devel. (En général, on trouve certains symboles manquants lors d'une compilation avec g++). Les paquets qui semblent souffrir de ce problème sont, pour l'heure, les suivants : octave, singular-factory, singular-libfac et peut-être sdl.</p>
<a name="21/08/2004%20Erreur%20dans%20fink%20version%200.22.0"><span class="news-date">21/08/2004: </span><span class="news-headline">Erreur dans fink version 0.22.0</span></a><?php gray_line(); ?>
<p>La version 0.22.0 du gestionnaire de paquets fink, qui a été disponible la semaine dernière pendant un court laps de temps dans la branche instable, a un bogue qui empêche la mise à jour via rsync. Si vous avez installé cette version de fink, vous pouvez rétablir la situation en exécutant d'abord la commande <code>fink install fink-0.21.2-1</code>, qui installera la version inférieure disponible dans la branche stable, puis en lançant la commande <code>fink selfupdate</code>.</p>
<p>Si, pour une raison ou une autre, ces commandes ne fonctionnent pas, allez sur la <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=17203">page de distribution du fichier fink sur sourceforge</a> et téléchargez le fichier <code>fink-0.22.1.tar.gz</code>. Décompressez-le en exécutant <code>tar xfz fink-0.22.1.tar.gz</code>, puis lancez la commande <code>./inject.pl</code> après vous être déplacé dans le répertoire fink-0.22.1.</p>
<p>L'équipe de fink vous prie d'accepter ses excuses pour cette erreur et remercie la communauté de ses utilisateurs de lui avoir rapidement signalé ce problème.</p>

<p>La décision de Fink de construire petit à petit son propre réseau de miroirs a été payante. Pour continuer à offrir un service de haute qualité, nous devons faire croître notre réseau de miroirs. Cela fait un moment que nous ne vous avons pas sollicité dans ce sens, il est temps de le faire maintenant. Fink remercie tous ceux qui nous offert leurs ressources. Nous manquons, en particulier, de miroirs en Europe Centrale, en Russie et en Extrême-Orient. Si vous avez au moins deux Mb à consacrer à un miroir rsync, ou plus pour un miroir de fichiers de distribution, veuillez <a href="mailto:mirrors@finkmirrors.net">nous contacter</a>.</p>
<p>Pour avoir une vue d'ensemble des différents types de miroirs que Fink propose, allez sur <a href="http://finkmirrors.net/">finkmirrors.net</a>.

<p>Les dernières versions de Fink 0.6.3 (pour 10.2) et 0.7.0 (pour 10.3) sont, dès à présent, disponibles sous forme de sources ou de binaires. La version 0.6.3 a été compilée sur <b>10.2</b>, tandis que la version 0.7.0 l'a été sur <b>10.3</b>. Cela devrait rendre la gestion des différentes plate-formes plus facile.</p>
<p>Dans ces nouvelles versions on a apporté différentes corrections au gestionnaire de paquets, ajouté de nombreux paquets binaires non disponibles sous cette forme auparavant, et recompilé certains paquets qui posaient des problèmes sur 10.3.</p>
<p>Pour faire une première installation de Fink, vous devez suivre les instructions données <a href="<?php print $root; ?>download/index.php?phpLang=fr">ici</a>.

<p>Grâce à la nouvelle équipe GNOME de Fink et au travail intense de notre nouveau constructeur de paquets Keith Conger et du mainteneur de GNOME 1.x maintainer Masanori Sekino, GNOME 2.4 vient d'être placée dans l'arborescence instable 10.3.</p>
<p>Vous n'avez qu'à le récupérer ; dédiez, si vous le pouvez, un peu de votre temps libre au test de ces paquets si vous avez déjà configuré Fink pour l'arborescence instable. De nombreux changements ont eu lieu ; il y a donc des chances pour que la mise à jour ou l'installation de la nouvelle version de GNOME posent quelques problèmes. Si c'est le cas, vous pouvez joindre l'équipe GNOME à <a href="mailto:fink-gnome-core@lists.sourceforge.net">fink-gnome-core@lists.sourceforge.net</a>. Envoyez-lui aussi un rapport quand tout s'est bien passé. Plus nous recevrons de rapports favorables, plus vite nous pourrons mettre GNOME 2.4 dans l'arborescence stable.</p>

<p>Bonne année à tous de la part de toute l'équipe.</p>
<p>L'année passée a été une bonne année pour Fink. Nous avons eu du mal à intégrer les changements introduits par Apple, mais nous avons aussi découvert que nous avions une communauté formidable prête à patienter très longtemps pour nous soutenir. C'est pourquoi nous vous disons "Merci". Le projet Fink avance principalement grâce au soutien et aux encouragements extraordinaires que nous recevons de nos utilisateurs.</p>
<p>En 2004, la tendance devrait s'accélérer. Il y a quelques petites choses intéressantes en vue : GNOME 2.4, une nouvelle version de KDE, des changements majeurs dans le gestionnaire de paquets, et une restructuration de l'organisation. Nous espérons pouvoir étendre le projet par des conférences développeurs, des rencontres et un CD dans votre magasin préféré.</p>
<p>Les grandes ambitions peuvent se révéler catastrophiques, c'est pourquoi nous les réaliserons en douceur, mais nous comptons toujours sur votre soutien cette année. Dites-nous ce que vous pensez de Fink ; si vous l'aimez ou non ; proposez-nous des idées d'amélioration. Prêtez-nous vos ressources et sponsorisez un mirroir ou du matériel. Consacrez un peu de votre temps à améliorer le gestionnaire de paquets ou à ajouter un logiciel en créant un fichier info. Faîtes-vous plaisir en navigant sur ce site. Nous sommes heureux de nous mettre au service d'une communauté aussi agréable. Nous espérons que nous vous ferons franchir, à vous et votre Macintosh, l'année 2004 sans encombres.</p>

<p> Puissent tous vos voeux se réaliser, que le monde devienne meilleur et que la paix et la compréhension y règnent ne serait-ce que pendant ces quelques jours.</p>
<p> Profitez de cette pause et encore meilleurs voeux pour la nouvelle année.

extremedsl</a> nous offrent un miroir complet à Perth, en Australie. Il s'agit de notre premier miroir à l'autre bout du monde, je suis donc d'autant plus heureux de l'accueillir dans notre famille. Le service <a href="http://www.mirror.ac.uk">UKMIRROR</a> nous a, par ailleurs, accepté, rendant les distributions de Fink disponibles sur 21 serveurs à charge partagée. </p>
<p>Nous en sommes très heureux, mais nous sommes toujours à la recherche de nouveaux miroirs basés sur rsync. Si vous désirez nous aider, allez sur <a href="http://finkmirrors.net">finkmirrors.net</a> et entrez contact avec nous. </p>

<p>Nous souhaitons la bienvenue à notre nouveau miroir situé en Norvège, sponsorisé par Havar Valeur, mais nous faisons encore appel à votre générosité. Pour améliorer le service qui vous est destiné, nous vous demandons de bien vouloir regarder si vous ne pourriez pas devenir miroir. </p>
<p>Il suffit de posséder un lien à 10 Mbit/s, environ 100 Mo d'espace disque disponible et de la bande passante à partager avec Fink. Les instructions précises pour la mise en place de rsync sont disponibles <a href="http://finkmirrors.net/rsync.html">ici</a>. Nous recherchons, en particulier, des miroirs en Asie, en Australie, en Nouvelle Zélande, en Europe méridionale et en Europe centrale : nous n'en avons encore aucun dans ces régions. Si vous vous sentez d'humeur particulièrement généreuse et désirez faire davantage, allez sur <a href="http://finkmirrors.net">finkmirrors.net</a> pour découvrir les options qui s'offrent à vous. </p>
<p>Vous pouvez connaître, à tout instant, l'état de nos miroirs rsync sur finkmirrors.net. Nous comptons améliorer ce service par la suite, ce qui ne pourra être fait que grâce à la bonne volonté de chacun. Nous pensons à de nombreuses autres applications et remercions d'avance l'ensemble de notre communauté. </p>
<a name="17/11/2003%20Fink%200.6.2%20est%20disponible"><span class="news-date">17/11/2003: </span><span class="news-headline">Fink 0.6.2 est disponible</span></a><?php gray_line(); ?>
<p>Les binaires et sources de la dernière version de Fink, numérotée 0.6.2, sont maintenant disponibles. Il s'agit d'une version destinée à corriger deux bogues de la version précédente : celui de la suppression utilisateur / dselect, ainsi qu'un problème d'autorisations attribuées aux fichiers. Le bogue dselect a été résolu en mettant à jour les paquets fink, dpkg et apt. Après mise à jour en version 0.6.2, vous pourrez utiliser de nouveau dselect sans problème. Cependant, si vous avez utilisé dselect sous une version au moins égale à la version 0.6.0, vérifiez l'intégrité du fichier <code>/sw/etc/apt/sources.list</code>. Si vous avez le moindre doute concernant ce fichier, nous vous recommandons de le remplacer par <a href="<?php print $root; ?>files/sources.list">le fichier sources.list par défaut</a>. </p>
<p>Les utilisateurs qui ont installé des fichiers binaires à partir de la distribution 0.6.1 pourraient constater que certains fichiers Fink appartiennent à l'utilisateur UID 20011 et non à l'utilisateur root. Pour corriger ce problème, lancez la commande :</p>
<pre>
sudo find /sw/ -user 2011 -exec chown root:admin {} \;
</pre>
<p>Cette version, comme la précédente, a été créée sous Mac OS X 10.2 et compilée avec gcc 3.3. Elle fonctionne correctement, à quelques exceptions* près, sous Mac OS X 10.3. La plupart des utilisateurs passant sous Mac OS X 10.3 devront utiliser les binaires de cette nouvelle distribution pour l'instant, tandis que l'équipe de Fink continue d'adapter les paquets Fink à Mac OS X 10.3. </p>
<p>*Quelques exceptions : emacs, qt. </p>
<a name="04/11/2003%20Risque%20de%20suppression%20d'utilisateur%20/%20Probl%C3%A8mes%20avec%20Dselect"><span class="news-date">04/11/2003: </span><span class="news-headline">Risque de suppression d'utilisateur / Problèmes avec Dselect</span></a><?php gray_line(); ?>
<p><b>En bref : N'UTILISEZ PAS DSELECT</b>, et si vous avez eu le malheur de le faire, vérifiez, dès maintenant, le contenu de votre fichier /sw/etc/apt/sources.list.</p>
<p>Les utilisateurs qui ont fait un bootstrap ou installé Fink 0.5.3 ou Fink 0.6.0 sous Mac OS X 10.3 pourraient rencontrer un problème majeur : tous les utilisateurs pourraient être effacés de la base netinfo, rendant l'ouverture de session impossible. Nous pensons que ce problème ne survient que lors de l'utilisation de dselect.</p>
<p>Si vous utilisez Mac OS X 10.3, procédez à l'installation de la toute dernière version de Fink pour éviter une telle déconvenue. Pour vous assurer que vous n'avez pas de problème de mise à jour rampant, vérifiez le contenu du fichier <code>/sw/etc/apt/sources.list</code>. Vous devrez le modifier s'il contient des lignes commençant par <code>deb</code> et pointant vers "release" ou "current" sans numéro de version spécifié. En d'autres termes, si votre fichier <code>sources.list</code> contient des lignes semblables aux lignes suivantes :</p>
<pre>
deb http://us.dl.sourceforge.net/fink/direct_download release main 
deb http://us.dl.sourceforge.net/fink/direct_download current main
</pre>
<p>vous devrez les modifier comme suit :</p>
<pre>
deb http://us.dl.sourceforge.net/fink/direct_download 10.3/release main 
deb http://us.dl.sourceforge.net/fink/direct_download 10.3/current main
</pre>
<p>Nous travaillons à la mise à jour du référentiel pour éviter la diffusion de code incorrect à la suite d'une mise à jour. Nous sommes en train de corriger le bogue de dselect mais, en attendant, vérifiez le contenu du fichier <code>sources.list</code>.</p>
<p>D'autres utilisateurs ont eu des problèmes avec dselect ; celui-ci prévient de l'absence d'un paquet "darwin". Si vous lancez dselect sous Mac OS X 10.3 et si vous <b>NE VOYEZ PAS</b> un tel avertissement, alors votre fichier <code>sources.list</code> est probablement corrompu et doit être réparé comme expliqué plus haut. </p>
<a name="01/11/2003%20Fink%200.6.1%20est%20disponible"><span class="news-date">01/11/2003: </span><span class="news-headline">Fink 0.6.1 est disponible</span></a><?php gray_line(); ?>
<p>La dernière version de Fink, numérotée 0.6.1, est maintenant disponible sous forme de sources et de binaires. Cette version a été réalisée sous Mac OS X 10.2 et compilée avec gcc 3.3. Elle fonctionne correctement sous Mac OS X 10.3. La plupart des utilisateurs passant sous Mac OS X 10.3 devront utiliser les binaires de cette nouvelle distribution pour l'instant, tandis que l'équipe de Fink continue d'adapter les paquets Fink à Mac OS X 10.3.</p>
<p>Pour accéder aux nouveaux binaires, utiliser apt-get, dselect, ou le mode binaire de FinkCommander. A moins de vouloir aider l'équipe de Fink à tester des paquets compilés spécialement pour Mac OS X 10.3, n'utilisez pas l'outil <code>fink</code> pour réaliser des installations pendant les prochaines semaines. </p>
<p>Pour mettre à jour une installation binaire, la méthode la plus simple est de lancer "sudo apt-get update". Vous trouverez de plus amples informations sur la mise à jour de Fink sous Mac OS X 10.3, ainsi que sur les problèmes qu'elle soulève sur la <a href="<?php print $root; ?>download/10.3-upgrade.php">page spéciale de mise à jour Mac OS X 10.3.</a></p>
<p>Avant d'utiliser la dernière version de l'outil en ligne de commande <code>fink</code> sous Mac OS X 10.2, vérifiez que vous avez bien installé le paquet August2003gccUpdater, disponible sur connect.apple.com après enregistrement gratuit. </p>

Il a été sponsorisé par le groupe utilisateur Apple <a href="http://mac.dir.hr/">Jabucnjak</a>. Il s'agit de notre premier miroir en Europe, et gageons qu'il ne sera pas le dernier. </p>
<p>Dave Schroeder de l'<a href="http://mirror.services.wisc.edu/">Université du Wisconsin</a> à Madison sponsorise un serveur maître dédié sur une ligne à 100Mbit. A. J. Wright et <a href="http://sunsite.utk.edu/">SunSITE@UTK</a> nous aident à mettre en place un autre serveur intégral aux États-Unis. </p>
<p>Ce qui élève le nombre total de miroirs intégraux à 4 et le nombre de miroirs rsync à 5. Nous sommes heureux d'avoir une communauté si fantastique avec nous, mais je sais que nous ne sommes pas au bout du compte. Je ne cesserai de vous harceler jusqu'à ce que Fink possède au moins un miroir dans chaque état des États-Unis. Épaulé par une communauté d'exception, je ne suis pas trop inquiet. Je pense pouvoir atteindre très bientôt cet objectif. </p>
<p>Toc, toc, toc ! Comme les enfants le jour d'Halloween, nous frappons à votre porte et vous réclamons ... des miroirs. À votre bon coeur, administrateurs de réseaux, remplissez notre corbeille. Vous trouverez des informations sur la création d'un miroir sur le <a href="http://finkmirrors.net">site officiel des miroirs</a>. </p>
<a name="25/10/2003%20Viens%20voir,%20un%20logo%20pour%20Fink"><span class="news-date">25/10/2003: </span><span class="news-headline">Viens voir, un logo pour Fink</span></a><?php gray_line(); ?>
<p>Comme vous l'avez certainement remarqué, Fink possède un logo, choisi à la suite du <a href="<?php print $root; ?>logo.php">concours de logo</a> qui s'est tenu au début de cette année. Ce nouveau logo officiel est affiché depuis le 24 octobre. Ceux qui veulent connaître les raisons de son choix et le nom du vainqueur du concours peuvent se reporter à la rubrique <a href="<?php print $root; ?>pr/index.php">relation-presse</a>.</p>
<p>L'explication est accompagnée d'une reproduction du logo à plus grande échelle, ce qui permet d'en apprécier les détails. Notre nouveau logo nous plaît et nous espérons qu'il vous plaira aussi. </p>
<p>IMPORTANT: Nous ne possédons pas d'accord de licence en bonne et due forme pour le nouveau logo, nous sommes donc dans l'incapacité d'accorder la permission de le distribuer. Pour l'instant, il ne peut figurer que sur les pages du site internet de Fink. Merci de votre compréhension. </p>
<a name="24/10/2003%20Mise%20%C3%A0%20jour%20gcc%203.3%20et/ou%20Mac%20OS%20X%2010.3"><span class="news-date">24/10/2003: </span><span class="news-headline">Mise à jour gcc 3.3 et/ou Mac OS X 10.3</span></a><?php gray_line(); ?>
<p>Fink peut maintenant être mis à jour pour profiter du compilateur gcc 3.3, ou pour fonctionner sous Mac OS X 10.3, si cette dernière version est installée. Les paquets binaires correspondant à ces mises à jour ne sont, cependant, pas encore disponibles. Si vous faites un usage intensif des paquets binaires, il est peut-être préférable d'attendre quelques jours avant de procéder à la mise à jour. </p>
<p>La mise à jour des Developer Tools d'Apple d'août 2003 devra impérativement être appliquée AVANT de procéder à la mise à jour de Fink, si la dernière mise à jour des Developer Tools installée sur votre machine est datée de juin 2003. Sous Mac OS X 10.3, n'oubliez pas d'installer XCode à partir du CD XCode avant de procéder à la mise à jour de Fink. </p>
<p>Pour mettre à jour Fink, il vous suffit de lancer la commande "fink selfupdate". La dernière version du gestionnaire de paquets fink détecte automatiquement les versions de Mac OS X et de gcc installées et se comporte en conséquence. </p>
<p>Pour faire une installation complète de Fink sous Mac OS X 10.3, nous vous recommandons de <a href="<?php print $root; ?>download/srcdist.php">faire un bootstrap à partir des sources</a>, en utilisant l'archive fink-full-0.6.0.tar.gz disponible sur <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=17203">la page des téléchargements de Fink</a> sur sourceforge. XCode doit être installé pour ce faire. </p>
<p>Notez qu'après installation de la version 0.15.0 de Fink, ou d'une version ultérieure, il n'est plus nécessaire d'installer le paquet system-xfree86. Fink peut déterminer automatiquement la version de system-xfree86 à utiliser, si vous n'avez encore aucun paquet X11 de fink installé. Si vous avez installé antérieurement un paquet system-xfree86, lancez la commande suivante : </p>
<pre>
sudo dpkg -r --force-all system-xfree86 system-xfree86-42 \ 
system-xfree86-43; fink selfupdate; fink index
</pre>
<p>L'équipe de Fink travaille sur l'adaptation des paquets à Mac OS X 10.3, mais la plupart d'entre eux fonctionnent déjà sur le nouveau système.</p>

<p>You are too late. Rus Foster from <a href="http://www.jvds.com">JVDS</a> beat you all to it. He is the first one to provide us with resources for a Fink rsync mirror. The mirror is located in Atlanta, GA and is updated every two hours, at 35 minutes past.</p>
<p>For those of you who are still waiting, join in. The more mirrors we have the faster you can rsync your info files. As per usual, updated and current information on the mirror structure can be found on <a href="http://finkmirrors.net"> Finkmirrors.net </a></p>

<p>..who will mirror Fink above all? There is a new player on the turf and it belongs to the Fink team. <a href="http://finkmirrors.net"> Finkmirrors.net</a> tells you everything you wanted to know about mirroring Fink and its related resources on your Server. As our mirror structure will hopefully grow in the future, this web-site will also hold information about each individual mirror.</p>
<p>To ensure that our service remains as stable as possible and to distribute the load imposed onto our main rsync server, we are looking for rsync mirrors or full mirrors. Those of you who are willing to share resources will find all the necessary information on <a href="http://finkmirrors.net"> Finkmirrors.net</a>. </p>
<p>UPDATE: Yes, I screwed up when I initially installed the DNS records. If you cannot connect please try again later. I am very sorry for this inconvenience. Thank you for your understanding.</p>

<p>The latest version of the fink package manager offers a new update method, <code>fink selfupdate-rsync</code>, as an alternative to the CVS updates which have been so problematic in the past few months. If you have difficulty updating to the new version, please follow <a href="<?php print $root; ?>download/rsync-upgrade.php"> these special update instructions</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, this version of the fink package manager is compatible with last summer's Developer Tools updates.  After installing both the new package manager and the Developer Tools update, fink will ask you to reset your gcc version whenever that is necessary.</p>

<p>As announced in <a href="http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2003-21.html">this CERT 
advisory</a>, it has recently been discovered that
the ftp servers for GNU software were compromised back in March, 
although it is not believed that any of the source code housed there
was affected.</p><p>Fink relies on MD5 checksums when downloading software, and we have had
no reports of incorrect checksums in Fink packages.  The Free Software
Foundation is in the process of verifying the integrity of all of the
source code distributed from that ftp site.  As of this writing, the source
code for the following Fink packages have not yet been verified:
<code>autoconf2.54</code>,
<code>emacs21</code>,
<code>gprolog</code>,
<code>groff</code>,
<code>guile16</code>,
<code>help2man</code>,
<code>jwhois</code>,
<code>libtool14</code>,
<code>libosip1</code>,
<code>sed</code>,
<code>slib</code>.
It may be difficult to install those packages at present.</p>
<a name="2003-06-26%20Developer%20Tools%20Update."><span class="news-date">2003-06-26: </span><span class="news-headline">Developer Tools Update.</span></a><?php gray_line(); ?>
<p><b>Quick Summary: DO NOT INSTALL THIS UPDATE.</b></p>
 <p>Apple has released a patch to the December 2002 
Developer Tools which includes gcc 3.3,
their new compiler.</p><p>Fink does not yet support compiling with gcc 3.3.  In addition, it is important
not to "mix and match" between compilers:  all C++ code in fink packages
needs to be compiled
with the same compiler.</p><p>For this reason, the Fink team recommends that if you update your
Developer Tools with the new patch, you should be careful to run
<code>sudo gcc_select 3</code>
prior to any "fink build" or "fink install" commands.</p>
<p><b>Update 30 June 2003:</b> A 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=2680195&amp;forum_id=2056">problem
has now been detected</a> with
the new assembler program which the update installs, which may prevent
certain Fink packages from being compiled at all if you install this
update.  </p>
<p><b>Generally, Fortran programs will break if you install the update;
the breakage does not stop by simply switching back to gcc 3.1.</b>
The Fink team is working on a workaround for this problem, but until it
is ready, if you need Fortran-related programs you should not install
the update.</p>

still leaves some problems however.  If you upgrade Virex with Fink not
installed, and subsequently
wish to install Fink, you will need to delete the <code>/sw</code>

Fink already installed, you should immediately run
<b>

<p>Ben Hines has created a script (available <a href="http://fink.cvs.sourceforge.net/*checkout*/fink/fix-fink/install_name_fix.pl">here</a>) that you can use
that will fix the install_name entries in Apple's X11 libraries,
but it will not repair software you have already built against the
broken libraries.</p>

<p>A problem was uncovered today concerning the versions of imlib,
 libpng, and gnome in Fink's unstable tree.  The Fink team is hard at
 work addressing this problem.  As a workaround, users can downgrade
their imlib package to the stable version, "<code>fink install
 imlib-1.9.10-9</code>", until the problem is fixed.</p><p>Many Fink users may be using Fink's unstable tree without being
fully aware of what this entails.  For a few months in the fall,
enabling the unstable tree was the only way to gain access to
 10.2-compatible versions of Fink packages.  
<b>That is no longer the case.</b>
Fink users who do not wish to help the Fink team with testing should
disable their unstable tree.  To do this, edit the file
<code>/sw/etc/fink.conf</code> and remove the items
 <code>unstable/main</code> and <code>unstable/crypto</code> from the
 <code>Trees</code> line.</p>
<p>The Fink team appreciates those users who are willing to stick with
the unstable tree, even when there are problems like today's, and provide
the team with prompt feedback.  This is a community effort and we
appreciate your participation.</p>

xfree86 packages, you should update to xfree86-base-4.2.1.1-1 and
xfree86-rootless-4.2.1.1-1.  These packages are recent additions to
the 10.2/unstable tree; to gain access to them, you may need to run 
"fink selfupdate-cvs" and/or enable the unstable tree</p>

<p>  Users are cautioned to use the binary installer for Fink 0.4.1 <b>only
once</b> on a given machine.  Due to an apparent bug in Apple's
Installer.app program, attempting a second installation on the same
machine can result in permissions being altered in the machine's root
directory, in some cases leaving the machine in a non-bootable state.</p><p> If Installer.app presents you with an "Upgrade" button rather
than an "Install" button when installing Fink 0.4.1, <b>do not proceed
any further!</b> </p>
<p>A new version of the binary installer for Fink 0.4.1 became available
on November 5.  The new version avoids
the problem of the machine not booting, but even with the new version,
users are advised to only "Install",
not "Upgrade."  (You can recognize the new version by its filesize of
12582912 bytes, while the old version had a filesize of 10541112 bytes.)</p><a name="2002-09-28%20Fink%200.4.1%20released"><span class="news-date">2002-09-28: </span><span class="news-headline">Fink 0.4.1 released</span></a><?php gray_line(); ?>

<p> This is the <b>last release for Mac OS X 10.1</b>. Future versions of Fink will <b>not</b> officially support Mac OS X 10.1 anymore, we are gearing all our efforts towards 10.2.</p>
<p> At the same time, this release is not meant for Mac OS X 10.2. Fink 0.5.0. which is targeted for October, will be geared towards 10.2. In the meantime refer to the news item below on how to upgrade Fink for 10.2.</p>

<p> A number of recent reports on the

infinite hangs during patching) when using Fink to compile packages while

<p>A test version of the 10.2 updater for Fink is now available. The update process is somewhat complicated at the moment, but is explained in <a href="<?php print $root; ?>news/jaguar.php">step-by-step instructions for updating</a>. We also have separate <a href="<?php print $root; ?>news/jag-bootstrap.php">instructions to install Fink from scratch on 10.2</a>. </p>
<p>At the moment, approximately 800 out of 1150 Fink packages have been made ready for 10.2. However, virtually all of these packages are still being tested and have not yet been moved to the "stable" tree in the 10.2 section; moreover, binaries for 10.2 packages are not yet available. </p>

<p>During the last few weeks, we got a lot of emails asking whether Fink will work Mac OS X 10.2.</p>
<p>The answer is: Yes, we will support 10.2. However, due to some
major changes in this new OS version, we had to make a lot of adjustments both
to the Fink tool itself and to many packages. The current binary distribution,
0.4.0a, will only work partially on 10.2. We are working on an upgrade guide,
as well as a new Fink release, to support 10.2.</p>
<p> If you upgrade your system to 10.2 before the official Fink update for 10.2 is ready,
 many Fink packages built on 10.1 are going to work fine, but others need to be rebuilt.
 Some packages need special changes to build on 10.2. Adding "unstable/main" to your
 list of trees in /sw/etc/fink.conf (see also the <a href="<?php print $root; ?>faq/usage-fink.php#unstable">FAQ</a>)
 will give you access to the latest versions of packages, many of which include important
 fixes for 10.2.</p>
<p>  As of now, please do not email us asking about 10.2 support. If you can't wait,
  consult the <a href="<?php print $root; ?>lists/index.php">mailing list archives</a> instead.</p>

<p>Yesterday version 0.10.0 of the Fink package manager was released to the unstable tree, along with version 1.6 of the base-files package. All Fink users which are using the unstable tree are recommended to update to this version. The easiest way to do so usually is to run 'fink selfupdate-cvs' which will automatically take care of updating these essential packages.</p>
<p>Please report any problems you encounter with this version via our bug tracker.</p>

<p>All Fink users are urged to update their <b> passwd </b> package to version 20020329 or newer. Older versions of the <b> passwd </b> package are affected by a bug which could lead to the loss of all data on your hard disk if you remove system users created by Fink manually from the system via System Preferences. (Removing them via the NetInfo tool is safe.) You can check the version of your passwd package by entering <b> dpkg -s passwd</b>. If your version is outdated, you can update to the current one in two ways: </p>
<ul>
<li>
  Via the binary distribution. First make sure you have the latest list of packages available: <b> sudo apt-get update</b>. Then you can perform the actual update: <b> sudo apt-get install passwd</b>. 
</li>
<li>
  Via the source distribution. First make sure you have the latest set of package descriptions: <b> fink selfupdate-cvs</b>. Then, update the passwd package: <b> fink update passwd</b> 
</li>
</ul>
<p>See <a href="<?php print $root; ?>faq/usage-general.php#passwd">Fink's FAQ, question 6.3,</a> for more information about the passwd package. </p>
