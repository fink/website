    <p>This is the list of frequently asked questions about Fink. Like in most FAQs, some questions are taken from real life and some are made up. It's really more like a documentation written in an ad-hoc, question and answer style.</p>
    <p>The FAQ consists of several pages, one for each section. All questions are listed and linked in the table of contents below.</p>

    <faqentry name="what">
      <question>
        <p>What is Fink?</p>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>Fink wants to bring more Unix software to Mac OS X, which results in two main goals:</p>
        <p>Goal number one is porting software to Mac OS X. That means we take commodity Open Source Unix software and fix whatever is necessary so that it will compile and run on Mac OS X. Sometimes that's easy, but it can also be very hard or even impossible for some packages. We're trying to provide tools and documentation to make this easier.</p>
        <p>Goal number two is making the results available to casual users.  For this, we build a distribution using package management tools ported over from Linux, namely <code>dpkg</code> and <code>apt-get</code>, written by and for the  <link url="http://www.debian.org/">Debian GNU/Linux</link> project. The binary distribution uses the <code>.deb</code> package format. For building packages from source, we have our own tool, named <code>fink</code>, which creates those <code>.deb</code> package files.</p>

    <faqentry name="naming">
      <question>
        <p>What does the name Fink stand for?</p>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>	Nothing, it's just a name. It's not even an acronym.</p>
        <p>	Well, actually Fink is the German name for Finch, a kind of bird. I was looking for a name for the project, and the name of the OS, Darwin, led me to think about Charles Darwin, the Galapagos Islands and evolution. I remembered a piece about the so-called Darwin Finches and their beaks from school, and well, that's it...</p>

    <faqentry name="bsd-ports">
      <question>
        <p>	How is Fink different from the BSD port mechanism (this includes OpenPackages and GNU-Darwin)?
		</p>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>	Some main advantages:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p> It's written in Perl, not make/shell. Thus it  doesn't rely on special features only found in BSD make. There is no need to flag packages that need GNU make to build.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p> dpkg provides sophisticated management for binary packages - smooth updating, special handling for configuration files, virtual packages and other advanced dependencies. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p> Fink doesn't install into /usr/local unless explicitly requested and doesn't require fiddling with /usr/bin/make or other system-provided commands. That makes it safer to use and reduces interference with Mac OS X and third-party packages to a minimum.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </answer>
    </faqentry>
    <faqentry name="usr-local">
      <question>
        <p>Why doesn't Fink install into /usr/local?</p>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>	There are several reasons, but the common line is "because breakage will occur".</p>
        <p>	Reason One: Third-party software. /usr/local is the well-established place to put software that is not part of the system shipped by the original vendor. This means that it is a good place to put stuff. However, it also means that other people will put stuff there, too. Most install routines will just overwrite what's there - this also applies to dpkg. One can, of course, choose not to install third-party software in /usr/local. Unfortunately, most installers don't tell you beforehand what they will install where.</p>
        <p>	Reason Two: /usr/local/bin is in the default PATH. This means that your shell will find the installed programs without additional measures. But it also means that you do have to take additional measures if you do not want to use the programs. In extreme cases, this can also affect the system itself - many parts depend on shell scripts.</p>
        <p>	Reason Three: The compiler tool chain searches /usr/local by default. The compiler searches /usr/local/include for header files and the linker searches /usr/local/lib for libraries. Again, this is sometimes a welcome convenience, but it's very hard to disable should the need arise. You can easily disable the compiler by putting a garbage file called <code>stdio.h</code> into /usr/local/include.</p>
        <p>	All that said, it is possible to install Fink into /usr/local. The installation script will warn you explicitly, but proceed once you acknowledge that you're doing this at your own risk.</p>

    <faqentry name="why-sw">
      <question>
        <p>Then why did you choose /sw?</p>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p> That choice is quite arbitrary, but is likely to stay for the foreseeable future for practical (upgrade) issues as well as the fact that it's safe from conflicting with other packaging systems.</p>

      <question>
        <p>Do you contribute your patches back to the upstream maintainers?</p>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>We're trying to. Sometimes sending patches back is easy and  everyone is happy once the next release of the package is out. Unfortunately with most packages it's not that easy. Some common problems:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The Fink package maintainer is very busy and doesn't have the time to send the patch and accompanying explanations to the upstream
          maintainers.</li>
          <li>The upstream maintainers reject the patch. There are lots of valid reasons for this. Most upstream maintainers have a strong interest in clean code, clean configure checks, and compatibility with other platforms.</li>
          <li>The upstream maintainers accept the patch, but it takes some weeks or months until they release a new version of their package.</li>
          <li>The package has been abandoned by the original authors and there will be no new releases into which the patch could be merged.</li>

      <question>
        <p>What is your relation with the Debian project? Are you porting Debian Linux to Mac OS X?</p>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>There is no formal relation between Fink and <link url="http://www.debian.org">Debian</link>. Fink is <em>not</em> a port  of the Debian GNU/Linux distribution. We have ported Debian's package management tools (dpkg, dselect, apt-get) though, and use these tools and the .deb binary package format. The actual packages are tailor-made for Mac OS X / Darwin and don't use the Debian source package  format.</p>

        <p>
          <link url="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</link> is aware of Fink and has given us some support as part of their Open Source relations efforts. In the summer and fall of 2001, they provided us with pre-release seeds of new Mac OS X versions in the hope that Fink packages can be adapted in time for the release. Quote:  <em>"Hopefully it underscores the commitment that many suspect we're not willing to provide. We'll get better at the open source game over time."</em> Thanks Apple!</p>

    <faqentry name="darwinports">
      <question>
        <p>What is your relation with Darwinports?</p>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>Darwinports and Fink are complementary projects. There is some overlap between the two projects, and several people contribute to both the Fink and DarwinPorts projects. For example, Benjamin Reed is doing the KDE packages for both. Darwinports and Fink are free to make use of each other's patches, and we have discussed collaboration on a new dependency engine.</p>
        <p>DarwinPorts started from scratch to try a different approach to a packaging system. Read the statement on <link url="http://darwinports.opendarwin.org/">the DarwinPorts homepage</link>

      <question>
        <p>What are Fink Mirrors?</p>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>Fink mirrors are rsync servers mirroring the current and stable description files that Fink uses to build packages from source.</p>

    <faqentry name="why">
      <question>
        <p>Why should I use rsync mirrors?</p>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>Rsync is a very fast protocol. It will update the description files faster than the old CVS update method. Furthermore, CVS updates are  always done from sourceforge.net while rsync updates can be done from a mirror close to you.</p>

      <question>
        <p>How can I find out what packages Fink supports?</p>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>Since Fink 0.2.3, there is the <code>list</code> command. It produces a list of all packages known to your Fink installation. Example:</p>
        <codeblock>fink list</codeblock>
        <p>If you're using the binary distribution, <code>dselect</code> gives you a nice browsable listing of available packages. Note that you must run it as root if you want to select and install packages from within dselect.</p>

    <faqentry name="proxy">
      <question>
        <p>I'm behind a firewall. How do I configure Fink to use an HTTP proxy?</p>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>The <code>fink</code> command supports explicit proxy settings that are passed on to <code>wget</code>/<code>curl</code>. If you were not asked for proxies on first time installation, you can run <code>fink configure</code> to set it up. You can also run that command at any time to reconfigure the <code>fink</code> command. If you  followed the instructions in the installation guide, and use  <filename>/sw/bin/init.csh</filename> (or <filename>/sw/bin/init.sh</filename>), then <code>apt-get</code> and <code>dselect</code> also will use these proxy settings. Make sure that you put the protocol in front of the proxy, e.g.</p>
        <codeblock>ftp://proxy.yoursite.somewhere</codeblock>
        <p>If you are still having problems, go into System Preferences, select the Network pane, select the Proxies tab, and make sure that the box labeled "Use Passive FTP Mode (PASV)" is checked.</p>

      <question>
        <p>Can I move Fink to another location after installation?</p>

      <answer>
        <p>No. Well, of course you can move the files using mv or the Finder,
        but 99% of the programs will stop working when you do. That's because
        basically all Unix software depends on hardcoded paths to find data

    <faqentry name="removing">
      <question>
        <p>How can I uninstall all of Fink?</p>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>Almost all files installed by Fink are in /sw (or wherever you
        chose to install it). Thus in order to get rid of Fink, enter this
        command:</p>
        <codeblock>sudo rm -rf /sw</codeblock>
        <p>The only exception to this rule is XFree86 or X.org. If you installed
        an X server through Fink (i.e., you installed the <code>xfree86</code>,
        <code>xfree86-rootless</code>, or <code>xorg</code> packages, instead of using
        <code>system-xfree86</code>) and want to remove it, you will need
        additionally to enter this:</p>
        <codeblock>sudo rm -rf /usr/X11R6 /etc/X11 /Applications/XDarwin.app</codeblock>
        <p>If you aren't planning to reinstall Fink you also will want to
        remove the "<code>source /sw/bin/init.csh</code>" line you added to
        your <filename>.cshrc</filename> file or the "<code>source
        /sw/bin/init.sh</code>" line you added to your
        <filename>.bashrc</filename> file, whichever is appropriate to your
        setup, using a text editor.</p>

      <question>
        <p>The package database at the website lists package xxx, but apt-get
        and dselect know nothing about it. Who's lying?</p>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>Both are correct. The <link url="http://pdb.finkproject.org/pdb/">package database</link> knows
        about every package, including those that are still in the unstable
        section. The <code>dselect</code> and <code>apt-get</code> tools on
        the other hand only know about the packages available as precompiled
        binary packages. Many packages are not available in precompiled form
        through these tools for a variety of reasons. A package must be in the
        "stable" section of the latest point release to be considered, and it
        must pass additional checks for policy compliance as well as licensing
        and patent restrictions.</p>
        <p>If you want to install a package that is not available via
        <code>dselect</code> / <code>apt-get</code>, you have to compile it
        from source using <code>fink install <em>packagename</em>
          </code>.
        Make sure you have the Developer Tools installed before you try this.
        (If there is no installer for the Developer Tools in your
        <code>/Applications</code> folder, you can get them from the <link url="http://connect.apple.com/">Apple Developer Connection</link>
        after free registration.) See also the question about unstable

    <faqentry name="unstable">
      <question>
        <p>There's this package in unstable that I want to install, but the
        fink command just says 'no package found'. How can I install it?</p>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>First make sure you understand what 'unstable' means. Packages in
        the unstable tree are not in stable for any number of reasons.  It
        could be because there are known issues, validation errors, or just
        not enough people giving feedback that the package works for them.
        For that reason, Fink doesn't search the unstable tree by
        default.</p>
        <p>If you do enable unstable, please remember to e-mail the
        maintainer if something works (or even if it doesn't). Feedback from
        users like you is what we use to determine if something is ready for
        stable! To find out the maintainer of a package, run <code>fink info
        <em>packagename</em></code>.</p>
	<p>For <code>fink-0.26</code> and later:  If you run
	<code>fink configure</code> one of the questions will ask whether you
	want to turn the unstable trees on.  </p>
	<p>To configure Fink to use unstable
	when you have an earlier version of the <code>fink</code> tool than
	<em>0.26</em>, edit
        <filename>/sw/etc/fink.conf</filename>, and add <code>unstable/main</code>
        and <code>unstable/crypto</code> to the <code>Trees:</code> line.</p>
	<p>If you use Fink Commander, then there is a Preference to use unstable
	packages.</p>
	<p>None of these options actually download the unstable tree's package
	descriptions.You'll need to turn on <code>rsync</code> or
	<code>cvs</code> updating to do this, which is not set up by default on a new
	Fink installation.  The following command sequence will set you up on
	a new Fink installation:</p>
	<codeblock>fink selfupdate</codeblock>
	<p>followed by</p>
	<codeblock>fink selfupdate-rsync</codeblock>
	<p>or</p>
	<codeblock>fink selfupdate-cvs</codeblock>
	<p>and then</p>
	<codeblock>fink index -f

      <question>
        <p>Do I <em>really</em> need to enable all of unstable just to install
        one unstable package that I want?</p>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>No, but it is highly recommended you do.  Mixing and matching can
        cause unforeseen issues that make it difficult to debug problems when
        they do arise.</p>
        <p>That said, if you only want one or two specific packages, and nothing
        else from unstable, then you need to switch over to CVS updating (i.e.
        use <code>fink selfupdate-cvs</code>), because rsync only updates the
        trees that are active in your <filename>fink.conf</filename>. Edit
        <filename>/sw/etc/fink.conf</filename> and add <code>local/main</code>
        to the <code>Trees:</code> line, if not present. Then you'll need to
        run <code>fink selfupdate</code> to download the package description
        files. Now copy the relevant <code>.info</code> files (and their
        associated <code>.patch</code> files, if there are any) from
        <filename>/sw/fink/dists/unstable/main/finkinfo</filename> (or
        <filename>/sw/fink/dists/unstable/crypto/finkinfo</filename>) to
        <filename>/sw/fink/dists/local/main/finkinfo</filename>. However, note
        that your package may depend on other packages (or particular
        versions) which are also only in unstable. You will have to move their
        <code>.info</code> and <code>.patch</code> files as well. After you
        move all of the files, make sure to run <code>fink index</code>, so
        that Fink's record of available packages is updated. Once you're done
        you can switch back to rsync (<code>fink selfupdate-rsync</code>) if
        you want.</p>

        <p>then it's likely that the cvs servers are overloaded and you have

        <p>Another possibility is that you have some bad permissions in your

        <p>The &quot;C&quot; means CVS had a conflict in trying to update the latest
        version.  The fix is to delete any files that show up as starting with &quot;C&quot; in
        the output of selfupdate-cvs, and try again:</p>

    <faqentry name="not-found">
      <question>
        <p>I'm trying to install a package, but Fink can't download it. The
        download site shows a later version number of the package than what
        Fink has. What do I do?</p>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>The package sources get moved around by the upstream sites when new
        versions are released.</p>
        <p>The first thing you should do is run <code>fink selfupdate</code>.
        It may be that the package maintainer has already fixed this, and you
        will get an updated package description with either a more recent
        version or a revised download URL.</p>
        <p>If this doesn't work, most sources are available on <link url="http://distfiles.master.finkmirrors.net/">http://distfiles.master.finkmirrors.net/</link>
        (thanks to Rob Braun) , and you can run <code>fink configure</code> to
        choose to search "Master" source mirrors so that Fink will
        automatically look there.</p>
        <p>If this doesn't work, please let the package maintainer (available
        from "<code>fink describe <em>packagename</em>
          </code>") know that the
        URL is broken; not all maintainers read the mailing lists all of the
        time.</p>
        <p>To get a usable source, first try hunting around the remote site in
        other directories for the same version of the source that Fink wants
        (e.g. in an "old" directory). Keep in mind, though, that some remote
        sites like to trash the old versions of their packages. If the
        official site doesn't have it, then try a web search--sometimes there
        are unofficial sites that have the tarball you want. Another place to
        look is <link url="http://us.dl.sourceforge.net/fink/direct_download/source/">http://us.dl.sourceforge.net/fink/direct_download/source/</link>,
        which is where Fink stores sourcefiles from packages that have been
        released in binary form. If all of the above fail, then you might
        consider posting on the <link url="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum=fink-users">fink-users
        mailing list</link> to ask if anybody has the old source available to
        give you.</p>
        <p>Once you locate the proper source tarball, download it manually,
        and then move the file into your Fink source location (i.e. for a
        default Fink install, "<code>sudo mv <em>package-source.tar.gz</em>
        /sw/src/</code>". Then use '<code>fink install <em>packagename</em>
          </code>' as normal.</p>
        <p>If you can't get the source file, then you'll have to wait for the
        maintainer to deal with the problem. They may either post a link to
        the old source, or update the .info and .patch files to use the newer
        version.</p>

      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>If this always happens, then you may have inadvertently
        modified (or failed to modify) your startup scripts. Run the
        <filename>/sw/bin/pathsetup.sh</filename> script in a terminal
        window. This program will attempt to detect your default shell
        and add a command to load Fink's shell initialization script
        into your shell's configuration. You'll then need to open a
        new terminal session so that your environment settings are
        loaded. <em>Note:</em> Some older versions fink called this
        script <filename>pathsetup.command</filename> instead
        of <filename>pathsetup.sh</filename>. Alternately, you can run
        the <filename>pathsetup.app</filename> application on the Fink
        binary distribution disk image.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, if you only have problems in the Apple X11
        terminal, the easy solution is to modify the "Terminal" entry in the X11 Application menu via the <em>Applications-&gt;Customize Menu... </em>option.  Instead of just</p>
        <codeblock>xterm</codeblock>
        <p>change the command field to read</p>
        <codeblock>xterm -ls</codeblock>
        <p><code>ls</code> here means <quote>login shell</quote>, and the result is that your full login setup gets used (just like the OS X Terminal).</p>
        <p>These <filename>/sw/bin/init.*</filename> scripts do much
	more than just add <filename>/sw/bin</filename> to your PATH.
	Many packages will not work correctly without these additional

        there are other directories ahead of it (e.g.

        <p>Typically these errors take the form:</p>

        check its integrity by running</p>
        <codeblock>dpkg --contents <em>full-path-to-debfile</em>

        <p>e.g.</p>
        <codeblock>dpkg --contents /sw/fink/debs/libgnomeui2-dev_2.0.6-2_darwin-powerpc.deb</codeblock>
        <p>If you get back a listing of directories and files, then your .deb
        is OK. If the output is something other than directories and files, or
        if you don't have the .deb file, you can still proceed because the
        error doesn't interfere with builds.</p>
        <p>If you have been installing from the binary distribution or you
        know for sure that the version in the binary distribution is the same
        as what you have installed (e.g. by checking the <link url="http://pdb.finkproject.org/pdb/index.php">package
        database</link>), then you can get a .deb file by running <code>sudo
        apt-get install --reinstall --download-only <em>packagename</em>
          </code>. Otherwise you can build one yourself by running <code>fink
        rebuild <em>packagename</em>
          </code>, but it won't install yet.</p>
        <p>Once you have a valid .deb file, then you can reconstitute the
        file. First become root by using <code>sudo -s</code> (enter your
        administrative user password if necessary), and then use the following
        command:</p>
        <codeblock>dpkg -c <em>full-path-to-debfile</em> | awk '{if ($6 == "./"){ print "/."; } \
else if (substr($6, length($6), 1) == "/")\
{print substr($6, 2, length($6) - 2); } \
else { print substr($6, 2, length($6) - 1);}}'\ 
&gt; /sw/var/lib/dpkg/info/<em>packagename</em>.list</codeblock>
        <p>e.g.</p>

        <p>When changing the Fink distribution (of which the source and binary
        distros are subsets), Fink needs to be told that this has happened. To

      <question>
        <p>I'm getting a strange usage message from the head command. What's
        broken?</p>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>If you're seeing this:</p>
        <codeblock>Unknown option: 1 Usage: head [-options] &lt;url&gt;...</codeblock>
        <p>followed by a list of option descriptions, you have a broken
        <code>head</code> executable. This happens when you install the Perl
        libwww library on an HFS+ system volume. It tries to create a new
        command <code>/usr/bin/HEAD</code>, which overwrites the existing
        <code>head</code> command because the file system is case-insensitive.
        <code>head</code> is a standard command used in many shell scripts and
        Makefiles. You need to get the original <code>head</code> executable
        back if you want to use Fink.</p>
        <p>The bootstrap script of the source release now checks for this, but
        you can still run into it if you use the binary release for first-time
        installation or install libwww after you installed Fink.</p>
        <p>This problem has also been reported due to the installation of
        <filename>/sw/bin/HEAD</filename> (not by any Fink package). This is
        easier to solve: rename <filename>/sw/bin/HEAD</filename>.</p>

      <answer>
        <p>If you have StuffIt Pro installed, it could be that you have
        "Archive Via Real Name" mode enabled. Check for a StuffIt preference
        pane in the System Preferences tool, and disable "ArchiveViaRealName"
        if it's enabled. It contains a buggy reimplementation of a few
        important system calls that will cause a number of strange and
        transient errors such as this.</p>
        <p>Otherwise, an  <filename>mv</filename> error typically means that
        another error happened earlier in the build, but the build process
        didn't stop. To track down the offending file(s), search in the output
        of the build for the nonexistent file, e.g. if you have something
        like:</p>
        <codeblock>mv /sw/src/root-foo-0.1.2-3/sw/lib/libbar*.dylib \
/sw/src/root-foo-shlibs-0.1.2-3/sw/lib/

### execution of mv failed, exit code 1

      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>This is a frequent source of problems, because the package
        configuration script finds headers and libraries in

        If you are having problems with a build that aren't covered by another

        <p>This means that somehow your dpkg database got damaged, usually

	<codeblock>package `fink-buildlock-foo-1.2.3-4':  missing version</codeblock>
	<p>(of course, replace <filename>foo-1.2.3-4</filename> with the package name you are seeing).</p>
	<p>When this happens, you should edit <filename>/sw/var/lib/dpkg/status</filename> as a superuser.
	Then go near the line number which shows up in the error message.
	You should see a <code>fink-buildlock-foo-1.2.3-4</code>
        package whose <code>Status</code> field is marked</p>
	<codeblock>install ok installed</codeblock>
	<p>Change that to</p>
	<codeblock>purge ok not-installed</codeblock>
	<p>Under other circumstances, there may be garbage in the file.  You can fix this situation by
        copying the previous version of the database, like so:</p>
        <codeblock>sudo cp /sw/var/lib/dpkg/status-old /sw/var/lib/dpkg/status</codeblock>

        <p>If you're using the unstable tree, make sure you have intltool-0.34.1or later installed.</p>
        <p>Otherwise, you need to make sure that you have the right variant of the xml-parser-pm package to match the Perl version for your system.  For example, if you're on Panther you should have <code>xml-parser-pm581</code> rather than <code>xml-parser-pm560</code> (you may also have the <code>xml-parser-pm</code> placeholder), since you have <code>Perl-5.8.1</code> rather than <code>Perl-5.6.0</code>.  If you're on Jaguar, and are using the default system Perl version, you'll have the <code>pm560</code> variant, and if you've installed <code>Perl 5.8.0</code> you may have the <code>pm580</code> variant.</p>

          <em>Note:  </em>Fink is deliberately set up such that all official binaries are identical regardless of what machine they are built on, so things like G5 optimization won't happen with an official package.  If you want them, you'll have to do it yourself.</p>

      <question>
        <p>Whenever I try to build from source, Fink keeps waffling between alternate versions of the same library.</p>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>Often, in a complicated build tree, you may find that some of the packages
	depend on a particular version of a library, and other depend on a different one
	(e.g. <code>db47</code> vs. <code>db44</code>).  Consequently, Fink may try to
	switch to whichever one isn't currently installed in order to satisfy the
	build dependency for the current package that you're trying to update.</p>
       <p>Unfortunately, due to limitations in the build-dependency engine, you
      may wind up with the dreaded</p>
      <codeblock>Fink::SysState: Could not resolve inconsistent dependencies</codeblock>
      <p>message when trying a sufficiently complicated <code>update-all</code>. This generally gives you a
      command to try to resolve the issue:</p>
      <codeblock>
fink scanpackages

sudo apt-get install foo=1.23-4	
      </codeblock>
      <p>but this may not work for sufficiently complicated updates.  You might need

### execution of /sw/bin/python2.4 failed, exit code 1</codeblock>
        <p>the problem occurs because the <code>python2*</code> packages write the current <code>MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET</code> to a configuration file when they're built and the python build utilities use this value when compiling modules. This means that if you have, for example, a <code>python24</code> package on 10.4 that was built on 10.3, either by upgrading 10.3 =&gt; 10.4, or via the <em>10.4-transitional</em> binary distribution, in which <code>python24</code> wasn't rebuilt, there will be a mismatch between what python thinks <code>MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET</code> should be (10.3) and what it actually is (10.4).</p>
        <p>The fix is to rebuild the offending <code>python</code> package, e.g. <code>fink rebuild python24</code> for the case above.</p>

        <p>I want to switch to Fink's XFree86 packages, but I can't install
        <code>xfree86-base</code> | <code>xfree86</code>, because it conflicts
        with <code>system-xfree86</code>.</p>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>All flavors of X11, unfortunately, really needs to be installed in
        /usr/X11R6. Because of this the Fink <code>xfree86-base</code> and
        <code>xfree86-rootless</code> packages install there, too. However,
        since Fink won't remove any files that aren't in its database, it
        won't automatically replace a non-Fink installation of X11.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Here's how to proceed:</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          <em>Note: 10.2.x users with up-to-date versions of Fink (&gt;=
        0.16.2) and 10.3.x users should skip step 1 below (it won't work
        anyway).</em>
        </p>
        <p>1. Remove <code>system-xfree86</code>. If you don't have any
        packages that depend on X11, this is straightforward. Frequently,
        however, many packages that depend on X11 are installed. Rather than
        uninstalling all of them, you can use</p>
        <codeblock>sudo dpkg --remove --force-depends system-xfree86</codeblock>
        <p>to remove it, leaving everything in place. If you don't have
        <code>system-xfree86</code> installed then proceed to step 3.</p>
        <p>2. Manually remove all of XFree86. This can be done with</p>
        <codeblock>sudo rm -rf /Applications/XDarwin.app /usr/X11R6 /etc/X11</codeblock>
        <p>If you are switching from Apple X11, remove the X11 application,
        too.</p>
        <p>3. To get XFree86-4.2.1, Install Fink's <code>xfree86-base</code>
        and <code>xfree86-rootless</code> packages by the usual means:
        "<code>fink install</code>" for source users, "<code>apt-get
        install</code>" or <code>dselect</code> for binaries.</p>
        <p>-or-</p>
        <p>3a. To get XFree86-4.3.x and above, install Fink's <code>xfree86</code> package, with "fink install xfree86"--the latest version (XFree86-4.4.x as of May 25th, 2004) isn't in the binary distro yet, and is currently only in the unstable tree [see <link url="http://www.finkproject.org/faq/usage-fink.php#unstable\">how to install unstable packages</link>].</p>

      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>If you are running the Fink version of XFree86 and you want to
        switch between the threaded and non-threaded versions of Fink, you
        need to manually remove the old version. This is done at the
        command-line with the commands:</p>
        <codeblock>sudo dpkg -r --force-depends xfree86-base 
sudo dpkg -r --force-depends xfree86-shlibs 
sudo dpkg -r --force-depends xfree86-rootless 
sudo dpkg -r --force-depends xfree86-rootless-shlibs</codeblock>
        <p>or to delete the threaded versions:</p>
        <codeblock>sudo dpkg -r --force-depends xfree86-base-threaded 
sudo dpkg -r --force-depends xfree86-shlibs-threaded 
sudo dpkg -r --force-depends xfree86-rootless-threaded

    <faqentry name="passwd">
      <question>
        <p>There are suddenly a number of strange users on my system, with
        names like "mysql", "pgsql", and "games". Where did they come
        from?</p>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>You have used Fink to install a package which is dependent on
        another package, passwd. passwd installs a number of extra users on
        your system for security reasons -- on Unix systems, files and
        processes belong to "owners", which allows system administrators to
        fine-tune the permissions and security of the system. Programs such as
        Apache and MySQL need an "owner", and it is insecure to assign these
        daemons to root (imagine what would happen if Apache were to be
        compromised and suddenly had write permission to all files on the
        system). Thus, the passwd package takes the work out of setting up
        these extra users for Fink packages that require this.</p>
        <p>It can be alarming to discover suddenly a number of unexpected
        users in your "System Preferences: Users" pane (on 10.2.x) or "System Preferences: Accounts" pane (on 10.3.x), but suppress the urge 
        to delete them:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>First of all, you have obviously chosen to install a package
          which requires their use, so deleting the user doesn't make much
          sense, does it?</li>
          <li>There are in fact a number of extra users already installed on
          Mac OS X that you may not have known about: www, daemon, nobody, are
          just a few of them. The presence of these extra users is a standard
          Unix convention for running certain services; the passwd package
          simply adds a couple of extra that Apple did not provide. You can
          see these Apple-installed users in NetInfo Manager.app, or by
          running <code>niutil -list . /users</code>
          </li>
          <li>If you do decide to delete these users, be very careful of how
          you go about it. Using the "System Preferences: Users" pane (on 10.2.x) or "System Preferences: Accounts" pane (on 10.3.x) will assign all of their files to a random administrator account, and
          there have been reports of havoc played with the administrator
          account's permissions. This is a bug with System Preferences, and
          has been submitted to Apple. A safer way to remove these users from
          your system is to do so from within NetInfo Manager.app or use the
          command line tool <code>niutil</code> in Terminal. Read the man page
          for <code>niutil</code> for more information about NetInfo.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Fink <em>does</em> request permission to install these additional
        users on your system during the installation of the passwd package, so
        this should not have come as a surprise.</p>

    <faqentry name="compile-myself">
      <question>
        <p>How do I compile something myself using Fink-installed
        software?</p>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <!-- TODO: maybe change this to use LIBRARY_PATH / DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH ? -->
        <p>When compiling something yourself outside of Fink, the compiler and
        linker need to be told where to find the Fink-installed libraries and
		headers.  It is also necessary to tell the compiler to use the
		appropriate target architecture.  For a package that uses standard
		configure/make process, you need to set some environment variables:</p>
        <p>-bash-</p>
        <codeblock>export CFLAGS=-I/sw/include 
export LDFLAGS=-L/sw/lib 
export CXXFLAGS=$CFLAGS 
export CPPFLAGS=$CXXFLAGS 
export ACLOCAL_FLAGS=&quot;-I /sw/share/aclocal&quot;
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=&quot;/sw/lib/pkgconfig&quot;
export PATH=/sw/var/lib/fink/path-prefix-10.6:$PATH
export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.5</codeblock>
        <p>-tcsh-</p>
        <codeblock>setenv CFLAGS -I/sw/include 
setenv LDFLAGS -L/sw/lib 
setenv CXXFLAGS $CFLAGS 
setenv CPPFLAGS $CXXFLAGS 
setenv ACLOCAL_FLAGS &quot;-I /sw/share/aclocal&quot;
setenv PKG_CONFIG_PATH &quot;/sw/lib/pkgconfig&quot;
setenv PATH /sw/var/lib/fink/path-prefix-10.6:$PATH
setenv MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET 10.5</codeblock>
	<p>(assuming that the build system is running OS 10.5 or later)</p>
        <p>It is often easiest just to add these to your startup files (e.g.
        <filename>.cshrc</filename> | <filename>.profile</filename>) so they
        are set automatically. If a package does not use these variables, you
        may need to add the "-I/sw/include" (for headers) and "-L/sw/lib" (for
        libraries) to the compile lines yourself. Some packages may use
        similar non-standard variables such as EXTRA_CFLAGS or --with-qt-dir=
        configure options. "./configure --help" will usually give you a list
        of the extra configure options.</p>
        <p>In addition, you may need to install the development headers (e.g.
        <em>foo-1.0-1-dev</em>) for the library packages that you are using,
        if they aren't already installed.</p>

        <p>Apple X11 doesn't keep track of the Fink environment settings,

          <li>
            <p>4.2.x from Apple (assuming you have the User + SDK packages installed): the <code>system-xfree86</code> package is automatically generated for current versions of Fink; do NOT install it. (Note that the public beta of Apple's X11 for Jaguar is no longer available, so this is only an option for you if you already have this installed, from the time in which it was available.)</p>

      <question>
        <p>What are all these <code>system-*</code> "virtual
	  packages" that are sometimes present, but that I can't
	  seem to install or remove myself?</p>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
	  Packages with names like <code>system-perl</code> are
	  placeholder packages. These do not contain actual files, but
	  merely serve as a mechanism for fink to know about programs
	  that have been installed manually outside of fink.
	</p>
        <p>
	  Starting with the 10.3 distribution, most placeholders
	  aren't even real packages that you can install and remove.
	  Instead, they are "Virtual Packages", package data
	  structures generated by the fink program itself in response
	  to a preconfigured list of manually installed programs. For
	  each virtual package, fink checks for certain files in
	  certain locations, and if they are found, considers that
	  virtual package "installed".
	</p>
        <p>
	  You can run the program <code>fink-virtual-pkgs</code>
	  (part of the fink package) to get a listing of exactly what
	  fink thinks is installed. Adding the <code>--debug</code>
	  flag will give lots of diagnostic information about exactly
	  what files fink is checking.
	</p>
        <p>
	  Unfortunately, there is no mechanism by which you can
	  install an arbitrary program yourself (outside of fink) and
	  have fink recognize that program rather than trying to
	  install its own version of it. It's just too difficult in
	  the general case to be able to check configure and compiler
	  flags, pathnames, etc.
	</p>
        <p>
	  Here are the most important virtual packages that fink
	  defines (as of fink-0.19.2):
	</p>
        <ul>
          <li>system-perl: [virtual package representing perl]
	    <p>
	      Represents <filename>/usr/bin/perl</filename>, which is
	      part of the default OS X installation. This package also
	      provides <code>system-perlXXX</code> and
	      <code>perlXXX-core</code> according to the version X.X.X
	      of that perl interpreter.
	    </p>
          </li>
          <li>system-javaXXX: [virtual package representing Java X.X.X]
	    <p>
	      Represents the Java Runtime Environment, which is part of OS
	      X (and Apple's Software Update). See
	      <link url="http://www.apple.com/java">Apple's Java
	      page</link> for more information.
	    </p>
          </li>
          <li>system-javaXXX-dev: [virtual package representing Java X.X.X development headers]
	    <p>
	      Represents the Java SDK, which must be manually
	      downloaded from <link url="http://connect.apple.com">connect.apple.com</link>
	      (free registration required) and installed. If you have
	      updated your Java Runtime Environment, your SDK may not
	      be updated automatically (and may even be deleted!).
	      Remember to check for (and download and install if
	      necessary) the SDK after installing or upgrading your
	      Runtime Environment. See also <xref chapter="comp-general" section="system-java">this FAQ
	      entry</xref>.
	    </p>
          </li>
          <li>system-java3d: [virtual package representing Java3D]</li>
          <li>system-javaai: [virtual package representing Java Advanced Imaging]
	    <p>
	      Represent Java extensions for 3D graphics and image
	      processing, which must be manually downloaded from Apple
	      and installed. See <link url="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=120289">Apple'

          <li>system-xfree86-shlibs: [placeholder for user installed x11 shared libraries]
	    <p>
	      Represent Apple's X11/XDarwin, an optional part of OS X
	      (X11User.pkg). These packages provide <code>x11</code>

        <p>Make sure you have the "eSound Output Plugin" selected in the XMMS
        preferences. For some strange reason, it selects the disk writer
        plugin as the default.</p>

          <li>Run <code>esdcat /usr/libexec/config.guess</code> (or any other
          file of a decent size). If you hear a short noise, eSound works and
          XMMS should work too if it's configured correctly. If you don't hear
          anything, esd isn't working for some reason. You can try to start it
          up manually with <code>esd &amp;</code> and watch the messages.</li>
          <li>If it still doesn't work, check the permissions on
          <code>/tmp/.esd</code> and <code>/tmp/.esd/socket</code>. Those
          should have your normal user account as the owner. If they aren't
          owned by you, kill esd if it's running, remove the directory as root
          (<code>sudo rm -rf /tmp/.esd</code>), then start esd again (as a
          normal user, not as root).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note that esd is designed to be run by a normal user, not by root.
        It usually communicates via the file system socket
        <code>/tmp/.esd/socket</code>. You only need the <code>-tcp</code> and
        <code>-port</code> switches if you want to run esd clients on another
        machine over the network.</p>

      <question>
        <p>I want the delete key in Apple's X11.app to behave like that in
        XDarwin.</p>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>Some users have reported that the behavior of the
        <code>delete</code> key is different between XDarwin and Apple X11.
        This can be rectified by adding lines to the appropriate X startup
        files:</p>
        <p>
          <em>.Xmodmap:</em>
        </p>
        <codeblock>keycode 59 = Delete</codeblock>
        <p>
          <em>.Xresources:</em>

        <codeblock>xterm*.deleteIsDEL: true 
xterm*.backarrowKey: false
xterm*.ttyModes: erase ^?</codeblock>

      <question>
        <p>I'm having problems with X11 and Fink.</p>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>There are two possibilities to consider.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>You are installing from binaries:</em>
            <p>Typically what you need to do is reinstall the X11User package,
	    since the installer application occasionally misses installing a file.
	    You may need to repeat this multiple times. Running</p>
	    <codeblock>fink list -i system-xfree86</codeblock>
	    <p>should show that the <code>system-xfree86</code> and
	    <code>system-xfree86-shlibs</code> packages are installed, and</p>
	    <codeblock>fink list x11</codeblock>
	    <p>should indicate that the <code>x11-shlibs</code> and <code>x11</code> virtual
	    packages are present.</p>
	    <p>If reinstalling the X11User package doesn't work, then consult the
	    <xref section="special-x11-debug">special debug</xref> instructions,
	    below.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>You are installing from source:</em>
	    <p>Typically this error means that you need to (re)install the X11SDK,
	    which is <em>mandatory</em> if you want to build packages from source.
            It is in the Xcode Tools folder of a Tiger DVD, or (Optional
            Installs/)Xcode Tools/Packages on your Leopard DVD(s). If you
            run</p>
            <codeblock>fink list -i system-xfree86  </codeblock>
            <p>it should show the <code>system-xfree86</code>,
	    <code>system-xfree86-shlibs</code>, and <code>system-xfree86-dev</code>
	    packages as installed.  If the <code>-dev</code> package is missing,
	    reinstall the X11SDK, since sometimes the Apple Installer misses a
	    file.  You may need to keep doing this.  If either of the other two
	    are missing, then reinstall the X11User package (same reason).  At
	    this point</p>
	    <codeblock>fink list x11</codeblock>
	    <p>should indicate that the <code>x11-dev</code>, <code>x11-shlibs</code>,
	    and <code>x11</code> virtual packages are present.</p>
	    <p>If reinstalling the X11SDK or X11User package doesn't work, then consult the
	    <xref section="special-x11-debug">special debug</xref> instructions,
	    below.</p>

      <question>
        <p>I'm still having problems with X11 and Fink.</p>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>If the hints in the  <xref section="apple-x11-wants-xfree86">Fink tries to install XFree86 or X.org</xref> entry don't help, or aren't applicable to your situation, you may need to flush out your X11 installation and remove any old placeholders and partially/fully installed X11-related packages:</p>
	<p>On Leopard, use</p>
<codeblock>
sudo pkgutil --forget com.apple.pkg.X11User
sudo pkgutil --forget com.apple.pkg.X11SDKLeo
</codeblock>
<p>Then, on either 10.4 or 10.5, run</p>
<codeblock>sudo dpkg -r --force-all system-xfree86 system-xfree86-42 system-xfree86-43 \
xorg xorg-shlibs xfree86 xfree86-shlibs \
xfree86-base xfree86-base-shlibs xfree86-rootless xfree86-rootless-shlibs \
xfree86-base-threaded xfree86-base-threaded-shlibs \
xfree86-rootless-threaded xfree86-rootless-threaded-shlibs
rm -rf /Library/Receipts/X11SDK.pkg /Library/Receipts/X11User.pkg \
 /Library/Receipts/X11Update*.pkg
fink selfupdate; fink index</codeblock>
        <p>(the first line may give you warnings about trying to remove
	nonexistent packages).  Then, reinstall Apple's X11 (and the X11SDK, if
	needed), or,
	if you're on 10.4, an alternative X11 implementation, like XFree86 or X.org.</p>
        <p>If you are still having problems then you can run</p>
        <codeblock>fink-virtual-pkgs --debug</codeblock>
        <p>to get information about what's missing.</p>
        <p>If you are running an earlier version of <code>fink</code>, then
        there is a Perl script (courtesy of Martin Costabel) that you can
        download and run to get the same information.</p>

    <faqentry name="tiger-gtk">
      <question>
        <p>After updating to Tiger (OS 10.4), whenever I use a GTK app, I get errors involving <code>_EVP_idea_cbc</code>.</p>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>This is caused by an apparent bug in Tiger's dynamic linker (current as of 10.4.1), but looks to be fixed in 10.4.3, and Fink has had a workaround in the guise of <code>base-files-1.9.7-1</code> or later.</p>
        <p>If you haven't updated Tiger and/or <code>base-files</code> yet, you can work around this issue by prefixing the name of the software you want to run as follows:
</p>
        <codeblock>env DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=: </codeblock>
        <p>E.g., if you want to use <code>gnucash</code>, you'd use</p>
        <codeblock>env DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=: gnucash</codeblock>
        <p>This method works for applications that are launched via the Application Menu in Apple's X11 as well as a terminal.</p>
        <p>You may find it preferable to set this globally (e.g. in your startup script, and/or in your <code>.xinitrc</code>, which you may need to do to run GNOME).  Put</p>
        <codeblock>export DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=:</codeblock>
        <p>in your <code>.xinitrc</code> (regardless of your login shell) or your <code>.profile</code> (or other startup script) for <em>bash</em> users and:</p>
        <codeblock>setenv DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH :</codeblock>
        <p>is the corresponding command to use in e.g. your <code>.cshrc</code> file for <em>tcsh</em> users.</p>
        <p>Note:  this will automatically be done if you install a recent enough <code>base-files</code>.

        <p>I can't get the help to work for any GNOME application.</p>

      <answer>
        <p>You need to install the <code>yelp</code> package.  This package was not placed within the GNOME bundle because it uses cryptography, and it was decided not to place all of GNOME in the crypto tree just to use the help system.</p>
