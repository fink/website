    <p>Welcome to the Fink Website Internationalization Howto. This document
    is intended to offer guidelines for people who want to contribute to the
    i18n effort for the Fink website.</p>

    <section name="what">
      <title>What is going on with internationalization of the Fink
      website?</title>

      <p>The Fink project has undertaken an effort to add full
      internationalization support to its website, in order to make the site
      more accessible worldwide. Thanks to Baba Yoshihiko, there is now a
      framework in which pages in multiple languages can be employed.</p>
    </section>

    <section name="languages">
      <title>Languages</title>

      <p>We currently have volunteers working on the following languages:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Danish</li>

        <li>Dutch</li>

        <li>English (the baseline documentation)</li>

        <li>French</li>

        <li>German</li>

        <li>Italian</li>

        <li>Japanese</li>

        <li>Spanish</li>

        <li>Simplified Chinese</li>
      </ul>

    <section name="helping">
      <title>Helping out</title>

      <p>If you wish to help out with the internationalization effort, there
      are several things that you can do:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Join discussions on the <link
        url="http://fink.sourceforge.net/lists/fink-i18n.php">fink-i18n
        mailing list</link>. This is where we will discuss the mechanics of
        internationalization, announcements of updates to documents will be
        made, etc.</li>

        <li>Look over the translation for your own language. You may have a
        translation that flows better than does the official one, you may find
        a translation error, and other possibilities.</li>

        <li>Become a translator yourself. If your language isn't currently
        represented (or even if it is), and you think you can provide an
        effective translation, then you may want to volunteer to be a
        translator for your language. <p>Be advised, however, if you are the
        first person to work on your language: there are quite a few documents
        that you will have to translate initially. Once this is done, there
        typically will be small changes made.</p></li>

  <chapter filename="files">
    <title>The Documentation Files</title>

    <shorttitle>Files</shorttitle>

    <preface>
      <p>The purpose of this chapter is to introduce you to the Fink
      documentation files, how to access them, and how to send changes to the
      Fink website and activate them.</p>
    </preface>

    <section name="requirements">
      <title>Requirements</title>

      <p>To work on the documentation files as a member of a translation team,
      you need:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>A CVS client to allow you to download the documentation from the
        Fink xml tree.</li>

        <li>A UTF-8 compatible text editor--a dedicated XML editor is a plus,
        since many of the files on the Fink website are generated from XML
        files.</li>

        <li>A checkout of the Fink xml tree, as per the <xref
        section="acquiring">instructions</xref> below.</li>

        <li>Working knowledge of Fink is also beneficial.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><em>Note:</em> "team member" is defined as someone who translates but
      is not ultimately responsible for uploading files to the Fink
      website.</p>

      <p>Team leaders must meet the above requirements, but should also
      have:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>A SourceForge account (free registration).</li>

        <li>Commit access to the Fink documentation tree. To get this, send a
        message to the fink-18n mailing list, letting them know your
        SourceForge username. One of the i18n Core Team will make the
        arrangements for you to have CVS access to the documentation
        section.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><em>Note: </em>a "team leader" is here defined as a person who is
      responsible for actually uploading changed files to the Fink website and
      activating those changes.</p>
    </section>

    <section name="setting-up">
      <title>Environment Settings</title>

      <p>You will want to set up your
      environment to save you some typing later on. The ensuing discussion
      assumes that you are using the built-in command-line tools on Mac OS X or
      another Unix-like OS.</p>

      <ol>
        <li><em>Team leaders only</em>: Modify your login files to add the CVS_RSH environment
        variable.<ol>
            <li>If you are using <filename>bash</filename> or
            <filename>zsh</filename> add the following:
            <codeblock>export CVS_RSH=ssh</codeblock>
            to your <filename>.profile</filename>.</li>

            <li>If you're using <filename>tcsh</filename> add the
            following:
            <codeblock>setenv CVS_RSH ssh</codeblock>
            to your
            <filename>.cshrc</filename>. <p>This will tell
            <filename>cvs</filename> to use ssh to gain access to the files.
            This is required.</p></li>
          </ol></li>

        <li><em>All members</em>: Create a file called .cvsrc in your home directory with the
        following line in it:
        <codeblock>cvs -z3</codeblock>
        By doing this, CVS
        will use level 3 compression by default (it's a good thing!)</li>
      </ol>

      <p>After these operations make sure to start a new terminal window to
      make sure your CVS_RSH environment is set.</p>
    </section>

    <section name="acquiring">
      <title>Acquiring Files to Work on</title>

      <p>For now, you must check out the xml branch of the web site:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Open a terminal</li>

        <li>Create a directory somewhere to contain the Fink xml branch, e.g:
        <codeblock>mkdir -p ~/Documents/Fink-i18n</codeblock></li>

        <li>Move to that directory: 
        <codeblock>cd ~/Documents/Fink-i18n</codeblock></li>

        <li><em>For non-leader team members (or leaders awaiting access):
        </em>Login to cvs.sourceforge.net anonymously: <ol>
            <li>
            <codeblock>cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/fink login</codeblock></li>

            <li>Push the enter key (no password, anonymous as default)</li>

            <li>Check out the xml module: 
            <codeblock>cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/fink co xml</codeblock></li>
          </ol><em>Team leaders: </em>Check out using your username:<ol>
            <li>You don't have to do the login step above, but can go right
            to
            <codeblock>cvs -d:ext:yourusername@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/fink co xml</codeblock>
            where <em>yourusername</em> is of course your
            SourceForge username.  You may get a message about the DSA key of the server
            being unknown. Go ahead and answer yes.</li>

            <li>In this case you should enter your SourceForge passphrase at the
            prompt.</li>
          </ol></li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section name="file-standards">
      <title>File Standards</title>

      <p>There are two different file standards you will have to be concerned
      with as a translator:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><em>Static (PHP only)</em> <p>These are documents whose
        organization (e.g. item numbering) isn't expected to change much on a
        day-to-day basis. In this case the document just has a PHP file, which
        you will translate.</p></li>

        <li><em>Dynamic (XML generates PHP and HTML)</em> <p>These documents
        (e.g. the FAQ) are updated and restructured more often, so they need
        the facility to be reorganized dynamically. Such documents use an XML
        file as the basis by which PHP and HTML files are generated, via a
        script. As a translator, your responsibility is to translate the XML
        file.</p></li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section name="updating">
      <title>Update to latest revision</title>

      <p>Since other translators will change some files (don't be afraid about
      that, CVS can take good care of it) after you checked out the files, it
      is a good idea that you update your working copy to the latest revision
      frequently. For updating, you can:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Move to the directory that contains the files you checked out,
        e.g: 
        <codeblock>cd ~/Documents/Fink-i18n/xml</codeblock></li>

        <li>Update it, e.g:
        <codeblock>cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/fink update -dP</codeblock>
        for team members without commit access,
        or
        <codeblock>cvs update -dP</codeblock>
        for team leaders.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>You may find a letter in front of one or more of the filenames when
      you do this. Consult the <xref chapter="appendix">Appendix</xref> for
      more information, as well as the cvs man page.</p>
    </section>

    <section name="initial-translation">
      <title>Initial Translation</title>

      <p>The files to translate, in order of priority, are:</p>

      <p><strong>Title</strong> (English version file)</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Constants file (<filename>xml/web/constants.*.inc</filename>)(see
        below)</li>

        <li>Static PHP files (e.g. <filename>xml/web/*.en.php</filename>)</li>

        <li>User's Guide (<filename>xml/uguide.en.xml</filename>)</li>

        <li>FAQ (<filename>xml/faq.en.xml</filename>)</li>

        <li>Running X11 (<filename>xml/x11/x11.en.xml</filename>)</li>

        <li>Document Index (<filename>xml/doc/doc.en.xml</filename></li>

        <li>Packaging (<filename>xml/packaging/packaging.en.xml</filename>)</li>

        <li>Porting (<filename>xml/porting/porting.en.xml</filename>)</li>

        <li>News (<filename>xml/news/news.xml</filename>)</li>
      </ol>

      <p>The <filename>constants.*.inc</filename> files are intended to deal
      with hard coded items in the PHP include files. They are mostly menu
      items and such, located on top and left of the pages. You should
      separate them from the scripts and create a constants.xx.inc file for your language. To do this, just issue the following command in a terminal window:</p>
      <codeblock>cp constants.de.inc constants.xx.inc</codeblock>
      <p>where xx is your language code (e.g.: fr for French language).
      Next, you'll want to translate the single quoted part of the define lines into your language. In case you don't understand German, here is the translation into English:</p>

      <codeblock>
/* The Sections. Used in Menu Navigation Bar */ 
define (FINK_SECTION_HOME, 'Home'); 
define (FINK_SECTION_DOWNLOAD, 'Download');
define (FINK_SECTION_PACKAGE, 'Packages'); 
define (FINK_SECTION_HELP, 'Help'); 
define (FINK_SECTION_FAQ, 'F.A.Q.'); 
define (FINK_SECTION_DOCUMENTATION, 'Documentation'); 
define (FINK_SECTION_MAILING_LISTS, 'Mailing Lists');

/* Contents as Table of Contents. Used in FAQ/Documentation Sections */ 
define (FINK_CONTENTS, 'Contents');</codeblock>

      <p>When you translate, you normally follow the steps as below (suppose
      you are translating the <strong>Running X11</strong> document into
      French):</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Copy the xml file 
        <codeblock>cp x11.en.xml x11.fr.xml</codeblock></li>

        <li>Edit the line to declare it is French and its encoding is UTF-8
<codeblock>&lt;?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8' ?&gt; ...
&lt;document filename="index" lang="fr" &gt; ...</codeblock></li>

        <li>Save as UTF-8 Be aware that the encoding must be utf-8 and take
        care not to change anything but true text.</li>

        <li>Once you are done, or just to test it, edit the
        <code>Makefile</code> to include your language as:
        <codeblock>LANGUAGES = en ja fr include $(basedir)/Makefile.i18n.common</codeblock> 
        <p>then type
        <code>make</code> in the directory. This should generate your PHP (and
        possibly some other) files as well as other files matching the languages in the Makefile.</p></li>
      </ol>

      <p>Note: If you see some misspelling or errors in the English file,
      don't change it, but instead report it instead to the <link
      url="http://fink.sourceforge.net/lists/fink-i18n.php">fink-i18n
      list</link>, so that the master English file is changed.</p>
    </section>

    <section name="check-work">
      <title>Check Your Work</title>

      <p>Before your work gets uploaded onto the Fink website, you should
      check how the documents look.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><em>The easy way: </em>Open the HTML and PHP files in your web
        browser. PHP files won't look exactly like you see them on the
        website, however.</li>

        <li><em>The best way: </em>You can use your builtin webserver to view
        your documents as they will appear as it will on Fink's website.
        Assuming that you are using the built-in server:<ol>
            <li>Edit <filename>/etc/httpd/httpd.conf</filename>, e.g.
            via:
            <codeblock>sudo pico /etc/httpd/httpd.conf</codeblock></li>

            <li>Look for a line that says:
            <codeblock>#LoadModule php libexec/httpd/libphp4.so</codeblock>
            and remove the #</li>

            <li>Look for a line that says:
            <codeblock>#AddModule mod_php4.c</codeblock>
            and remove the #</li>

            <li>If you are running a version of Apache older than the built-in
            one for Panther then you may also have to look for a line that
            looks like
            <codeblock>AddType application/x-httpd-php .php</codeblock>
            and put a # in front of it.</li>

            <li>Save the file and exit your editor.</li>

            <li>Start Personal Web Sharing in System Preferences--if it's
            already running then turn it off and back on again.</li>

            <li>The easiest way to make everything visible is to move your
            checkout of the <filename>xml </filename>Tree into the
            <filename>Sites </filename>folder in your Home folder. You can
            then open the homepage in your web browser at the following
            URL:
            <codeblock>http://127.0.0.1/~<em>USERNAME</em>/xml/web/index.php</codeblock>
            where
            <code>USERNAME </code> should be replaced by your username.</li>
          </ol></li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section name="change-checkout">
      <title>When You Get Commit Access (Team Leaders)</title>

      <p>Once you have been given commit access, you should</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Set up an SSH key for your SourceForge account.<ol>
            <li>Set the key up on your machine following the <link
            url="http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=761&amp;group_id=1#keygenopenssh">instructions</link>
            from SourceForge.</li>

            <li>Type in the terminal: 
            <codeblock>cat ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub | pbcopy</codeblock>
            This will copy the contents of the file directly
            to your pasteboard, to avoid spurious linebreaks. Make sure not to
            copy anything else to the pasteboard until you're done.</li>

            <li>Log in to your account on SourceForge.</li>

            <li>Select "Account Options"</li>

            <li>Go to the "Host Access Information" area, and click on "Edit
            SSH Keys for Shell/CVS"</li>

        <li>Check out the <code>xml </code>tree using your username.<ol>
            <li>If you checked out the whole <filename>xml </filename>tree
            initially, then you should rename your local copy. You can use the
            Finder for this.</li>

            <li>Move to that directory in a terminal window: 
            <codeblock>cd ~/Documents/Fink-i18n</codeblock></li>

            <li>Do the checkout of the xml tree:
            <codeblock>cvs -d:ext:yourusername@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/fink co xml</codeblock>
            where <em>yourusername</em> is of course your
            SourceForge username. Enter your passphrase where prompted.</li>

            <li>Copy the files that you were working on from your old tree to
            the new one. Feel free to use the Finder, making sure that they go
            in the same subfolder as they were initially.</li>

    <section name="committing">
      <title>Committing the Changes (Team Leaders)</title>

      <p>Now you need to send your changes to the main server. To do this you
      need to make sure that you have commit access. You also should make sure
      that you are always using the latest version of XSLT in unstable tree, which is 
      <filename>libxslt-1.1.2-2</filename> from Fink as the time of writing this document.</p>

      <p>The procedure is different accourding to the nature - static or dynamic - of the documents:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><em>Static: </em>(PHP files only) To commit these documents do the
        following: <ol>
            <li>Open a terminal.</li>

            <li>Move to the directory that contains the file you want to check
            in, e.g: 
            <codeblock>cd ~/Documents/Fink-i18n/xml/web</codeblock>
            <p>if you created your <filename>xml</filename> tree under
            <filename>Documents/Fink-i18n/</filename> in your home folder, and
            you want to commit a PHP file from the xml/web directory.</p></li>

            <li>If the file is a new one that you've created, then you need to
            add it to the list of files, e,g.:
            <codeblock>cvs add download.ru.php</codeblock>
            Give your SourceForge passphrase at the
            prompt.<p>If the file already
            exists, you can skip to the next step.</p></li>

            <li>Commit the file, e.g. in the prior example:
            <codeblock>cvs ci -m "message" download.ru.php</codeblock>
            where once again
            <em>message </em>should indicate what you've done. Give your
            SourceForge passphrase at the prompt. 
            <p>Note: you can commit multiple files at once.</p></li>
            </ol></li>

        <li><em>Dynamic: </em>(XML and PHP) After you've modified the XML
        file, do the following:<ol>
            <li>Open a terminal</li>

            <li>Move to the directory that contains the file you've added or
            modified, e.g.
            <codeblock>cd ~/Documents/Fink-i18n/xml/faq</codeblock>
            if you've been working on
            the FAQ.</li>

            <li>Now run
            <codeblock>make check</codeblock>
            To ensure that the
            file is valid.</li>

            <li>If the XML file is a new one that you've created, then you
            need to add it to the list of files, e,g.:
            <codeblock>cvs add faq.ru.xml</codeblock>
            You'll need to give your SourceForge
            passphrase.<p>If the file already exists, you can
            skip to the next step.</p></li>

            <li>Commit the file, e.g.:
            <codeblock>cvs ci -m "message" faq.ru.xml</codeblock>
            <p> where <em>message</em> is a descriptive
            message about what you've done. Enter your SourceForge passphrase at
            the prompt. 
            Don't forget to also commit the Makefile if you've changed it (i.e. you've added your langague in it)</p></li>

            <li>Now run
            <codeblock>make &amp;&amp; make install</codeblock></li>

            <li>Move into your copy of the Fink xml tree, e.g: 
            <codeblock>cd ~/Documents/Fink-i18n/xml</codeblock>
            <p>if you created your
            <filename>xml</filename> tree under
            <filename>Documents/Fink-i18n/</filename> in your home
            folder.</p></li>

            <li>If the XML file was new, you'll need to do some more CVS
            adding. For example, if you have been working on the FAQ, then,
            you'll want to run (e.g.):
<codeblock>cvs add web/faq/index.en.php web/faq/general.ru.php \ 
web/faq/relations.ru.php web/faq/usage-fink.ru.php \ 
web/comp-general.ru.php web/faq/comp-packages.ru.php \ 
web/faq/usage-general.ru.php web/faq/usage-packages.ru.php \ 
web/faq/upgrade-fink.ru.php web/faq/mirrors.ru.php \ 
web/faq/faq.ru.html web/faq/header.ru.inc \ 
scripts/installer/dmg/faq.ru.html</codeblock>
For other
            documents, the files will of course be different--use whatever
            gets created for your language when you run <code>make
            install</code>.</li>

         <li>Don't forget to add and commit any file you've created (be it constants.xx.inc, header.xx.inc, nav.xx.inc, etc.)
          <p>If the file already exists, you can
            skip to the next step.</p></li>

            <li>Commit the whole tree:
            <codeblock>cvs ci -m "message"</codeblock>
            <p>Where once again <em>message</em> is a
            descriptive log message (you may want to use the same one as when
            you committed the XML file). Enter your SourceForge passphrase at
            the prompt.</p><p>The reason that you have to do two
            commits in this case is that it's required to ensure that the
            files show the correct creation time and person who last modified
            them.</p></li>

      <p>In order that things go smoothly, the following procedures should be
      followed.</p>

    <section name="new-translation">
      <title>New Translations</title>

      <p>When a new language is being translated, we will declare a freeze in
      updating the English and other languages) documentation, so that the
      translation team for the new language doesn't have to worry about having
      a document change on them before they finish it. In such a case, each
      document will be brought online as it is ready, and activated.</p>
    </section>

    <section name="doc-updates">
      <title>Content Updates</title>

      <p>Since the English documentation is the baseline, it must be updated
      first. Such an update may come from a member of the i18n team (e.g. the
      English Documentarians) or directly from the core developers.</p>

      <p>There are a couple of classifications for documentation updates:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><em>Urgent (security, bugfixes, etc.):</em> The base English
        documentation gets updated immediately, and translators update their
        individual documents and get them online as soon as possible.</li>

        <li><em>Not urgent:</em> In this case, the basic English documentation
        is updated, but not put online immediately. All translators do their
        work and get their version online within a day or two, then all
        versions get put online at the same time.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section name="call-to-translate">
      <title>Call to Translate</title>

      <p>Once the English files are done, a message will be posted to the
      fink-18n list informing all translators of the fact. The message will
      contain the following:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>A note in the subject line indicating that this is a request for
        translation, e.g. "[translation]", or "[translation-urgent]" for items
        where the English documentation is going online immediately.</li>

        <li>In addition, the filename of the base file should be included
        somewhere in the message.</li>

        <li>A full diff, e.g.: 
        <codeblock>diff -Nru3 -r<em>last_revision</em> r<em>head</em> </codeblock>
        to show the modifications in context.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Note: since committing the XML file automatically produces a message
      on fink-commits that meets all of these criteria, an easy thing to do is
      to redirect such a message and re-title the subject.</p>
    </section>

    <section name="translate">
      <title>Translation</title>

      <p>Now the actual work of translation proceeds. As each document is
      done, it gets committed to CVS.</p>
    </section>

    <section name="activation">
      <title>Activating the Changes</title>

      <p>There are two options for activating changes:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>For urgent changes, immediately after a document gets done, its
        changes get activated.</li>

        <li>For non-urgent changes, the changes will be activated after all
        language versions of the document are finished.</li>

      <title>CVS codes</title>

      <p>When you are updating your CVS checkout, you may see some letters
      before the filenames. These represent the following conditions:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><em>P:</em> There is a new version of the file via a patch.</li>

        <li><em>U:</em> There is a new version of the file via download.</li>

        <li><em>M:</em> The version in your local repository has been
        modified.</li>

        <li><em>C:</em> Your version conflicts with that in the remote
        repository. You should resolve this by editing the the file and
        merging your modifications. <p>You can use </p>
        <codeblock>rm file; cvs update file</codeblock>
        <p>where <code>file </code>is the offending
        file, to resolve the conflict, and then apply the changes from the
        backup of your file that exists
        under<filename>.#file-version</filename></p>, where <em>version
        </em>is the revision that your file started from.</li>

        <li><em>?:</em> The file is neither in the remote repository nor in
        the files to be ignored.</li>

        <li><em>R:</em> The file has been removed but not committed yet.</li>
