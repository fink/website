 <headline>Further 10.15 (Catalina) and Xcode11 upgrade details</headline>
 <body>
  <p>If upgrading to macOS 10.15 (Catalina) from an earlier macOS release, your existing Fink install will cease to work if installed outside <code>/opt</code> (such as to the previous default <code>/sw</code>) and must be reinstalled from scratch using Fink release 0.45.0 or later.</p>
  <p>The old Fink install is archived into <code>/Users/Shared/Relocated Items</code>. It's possible to manually recover downloaded source archives and configuration files from there to use in a new Fink install. However, it's not possible to reuse built .deb packages because they hardcode the original path that contained Fink.</p>
  <p>Upgrade and installation hints if existing Fink install is outside <code>/opt</code>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If doing a fresh Fink install on any macOS version, install Fink into <code>/opt/sw</code>.</li>
    <li>If you haven't yet updated to macOS 10.15, run this command to capture the list of your currently installed packages: <code>for i in `/bin/ls -1 /sw/var/lib/dpkg/info/*.list`; do basename -s .list $i >> ~/my_fink_packages.txt; done</code>.</li>
    <li>If you have already updated to macOS 10.15 but had Fink installed somewhere outside <code>/opt</code> before your system upgrade, use the above command (with modified path to the "Relocated Items" location as necessary) to capture the packages you previously had installed on your older macOS release. For example: <code>for i in `/bin/ls -1 "/Users/Shared/Relocated Items/sw/var/lib/dpkg/info/"*.list`; do basename -s .list $i >> ~/my_fink_packages.txt; done</code></li>
    <li>Once you have captured your list of previous packages, upgraded to macOS 10.15, and installed Fink into <code>/opt</code>, run the following command to batch build and reinstall your previous Fink packages: <code>cat ~/my_fink_packages.txt | xargs fink reinstall</code>. Note that some packages do not exist on macOS 10.15, so you might need to hand edit the file <code>my_fink_packages.txt</code> to remove the missing packages before trying to reinstall.</li>
  </ul>

 <headline>10.15 (Catalina) and Xcode11 information</headline>
 <body>
  <p>Fink 0.45.0 and up support the upcoming 10.15 release, but there are some important things to note:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Apple locked down the <code>/ (root)</code> directory where Fink normally installs (in <code>/sw</code> by default), so existing Fink installs may become read-only upon updating to 10.15.</li>
    <li>Xcode11 introduces some known breakages (with no known fixes at this time) to important packages like gcc, so not everything will build yet.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Once macOS 10.15 is officially released, we suggest waiting to upgrade until we know how the system will treat existing installs and we can determine the best upgrade path.</p>
  <p>For anyone installing Fink for the first time (on 10.15beta or an earlier macOS version), we now recommend using <code>/opt/sw</code> as the install location, since that's known to work. The next Fink release after macOS 10.15 is out will use <code>/opt/sw</code> as the default install location.</p>
  <p>Xcode11 is known to currently break building the gccX and several other important packages. If possible (especially 10.14 users), hold off on upgrading to Xcode11 unless you need something specific from it. If you do upgrade to Xcode11, make sure that the Command Line Tools are also upgraded to version 11 for your macOS release.</p>

 <headline>Fink for High Sierra (10.13)</headline>
 <body>
  <p>Because of a recent Sourceforge outage, we haven't been able to do a proper <code>fink</code> 
  release that supports High Sierra.  However, since the <code>fink</code> source on 
  Github isn't affected by this, it is possible to get a pre-release version out of our
  <code>git</code> repository and install that.</p>
  <p>The following sequence of steps should allow you to update your Fink installation
  on 10.9 (Mavericks) or later for High Sierra.  10.8 (Mountain Lion) or earlier 
  have no supported upgrade path.</p>
  <p>0) Don't update your OS yet!</p>
  <p>1) Download a copy of the 
  <link url="https://github.com/fink/fink/archive/master.zip">repository archive</link> and
  uncompress it if your browser doesn't do that automatically.</p>
  <p>2) Open a Terminal window and change to the resulting <code>fink-master</code> directory
  e.g. <code>cd ~/Downloads/fink-master</code> .</p>
  <p>3) Run the command <code>sudo ./inject.pl</code> to update <code>fink</code>.</p>
  <p>4) Update your OS to High Sierra.</p>
  <p>5) Open a Terminal window and run <code>fink reinstall fink</code> to reset your distribution.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>For new installs on High Sierra:</p>
  <p>1) Install the Xcode 9 command-line tools by running <code>sudo xcode-select --install</code> 
  in a Terminal window.</p>
  <p>2) Install the latest JDK from Oracle, e.g. by running <code>javac</code> in a Terminal 
  window.</p>
  <p>3) Follow steps 1-2) from the upgrade instructions above.</p>
  <p>4) Run <code>sudo ./bootstrap</code></p>
  <p>5) The default bootstrap operation will error out at the end for the time being, until 
  an official High Sierra binary distribution has been uploaded.  Go ahead and run <code>
  /sw/bin/pathsetup.sh</code> as usual, however.</p>

 <headline>fink-0.36.5 and fink-0.37.0 released. End of official support for 10.6.</headline>
 <body>
  <p>
  <code>fink-0.37.0</code> and <code>fink-0.37.0</code> were released on 4 June, 2014.
  These <code>fink</code> releases contain fixes for Java detection on 10.6 if older
  versions of Apple's Java SDK are installed.  <code>fink-0.37.0</code> officially 
  recognizes OS 10.9.3.  In addition, Fink's compiler wrappers are 
  now installed directly by the fink package to make for easier modifications.
  </p>
  <p>
  <code>fink-0.36.5</code> marks the end of 10.6 support by the Fink Project.  Users
  who want package updates should contact the maintainers of the respective packages.
  Unmaintained packages can be updated by request as well.

 <headline>fink-0.36.4 released</headline>
 <body>
  <p>
  <code>fink-0.36.4</code> was released on 6 April, 2014.
  This <code>fink</code> release restores the use of an official binary distribution by
  default on 10.8 and 10.9 (if distributions are created for 10.6 and 10.7
  those will be supported, too).  In addition, it works around the multiple
  build failures introduced by Xcode 5.1 on 10.8 and 10.9. This release also includes 
  official support for OS X 10.9.2, fixes the bootstrap operation when Xcode.app isn't
  present, and makes x86_64 the default architecture for 10.6 bootstraps.
  </p>
  <p>Users are encouraged to run <code>fink selfupdate</code> to install this version of
  fink, particularly in view of the Xcode 5.1 build issues.</p>

  We've been having issues with the master rsync server, which haven't been
  resolved as of yet.  Unfortunately, this affects all but two of the other
  servers.  To work around this problem, edit <filename>/sw/etc/fink.conf</filename>
  as an administrator and change your <code>Mirror-rsync</code> setting to one of</p>

 <body>
  <p>
  <code>fink-0.36.3.1</code> was released on 30 December, 2013.
  This release includes official support for OS X 10.9.1, and fixes an 
  issue in which the fink couldn't directly access official or unofficial 
  binary distributions on 64-bit platforms.  It also fixes an issue with 
  32-bit platforms which was introduced in fink-0.36.3.

  <p>
  <code>fink-0.36.1</code> was released on 17 November, 2013.
  This release fixes an intermittent bug in building Perl modules
  which was introduced with fink-0.36.0.  We encourage our users to
  install fink-0.36.1 to rectify this issue, and if you are having
  problems with installing a Perl module, use <code>fink rebuild</code>
  on it.
  </p>
  <p>
  In addition, the bootstrap  script now validates whether the Mavericks 
  command-line build tools are installed on that OS version, and prevents 
  folks from bootstrapping with the wrong tools.

    <headline>Fink and Lion--updated.</headline>
    <body>
      <p>OS X 10.7 "Lion" was released on July 20, 2011.  We want to let Fink
      users know what to expect if updating.</p>
<p>First, the <code>fink</code> 
program itself will not run  on a system which has
been upgraded to Lion.  However, it will be possible to use the
<code>dpkg</code> program to extract a list of the Fink packages
which had been installed under 10.6, so that they can be reinstalled
under 10.7.  Use</p>
<p><code>dpkg --get-selections | cut -f1 > fink_packages.txt</code></p>
<p>to extract the packages, and</p>
<p><code>cat fink_packages.txt | xargs fink install</code></p>
<p>once you have installed Fink for 10.7.</p>
<p>To upgrade Fink after upgrading to Lion, one will have to bootstrap
Fink again, using a tarball for <code>fink-0.31.0</code> or later.</p>
<p>Second, due to lots of changes under the hood, there currently are many fewer
Fink packages which build under 10.7 as opposed to 10.6.
Thus, even if you've extracted a list of Fink packages which had
been installed under 10.6, some of them may not yet be installable under
10.7.  We are currently creating a database showing which packages
can be successfully installed under 10.7, and work is ongoing to add packages.</p>
<p>10.7 introduces several drastic changes to how the system works. While this may
cause a slight delay in full Fink functionality in the short term, it will
make Fink work better in the future.</p>

    <headline>Happy 10th Birthday to Fink!</headline>
    <body>
      <p>The Fink project was started in the waning days of December 2000 by
Christoph Pfisterer, using the "public beta" release of Mac OS X.
Within a year, versions 10.0 and 10.1 of OS X had been released, and
Fink usage took off.  Our founder chrisp stepped away from the project
in November 2001, and the community took over.</p>
<p>The Fink community is the heart of Fink, involving both package maintainers
and Fink users, as well as the small core team which tries to keep the
overall system in good shape.  The success of this community in keeping
Fink viable and active over ten years is really quite remarkable!  Let's
all join together to keep Fink going for a long time to come.</p>
<p>How long?  In the memorable words of Buzz Lightyear: <code>To Infinity

    <headline>Fink on 10.6.</headline>
    <body>
      <p>
Fink is ready to be used on Snow Leopard (OS X v. 10.6).  Users will
need to choose between a 32-bit version of fink and a 64-bit version of fink
for 10.6.
The 32-bit version has more packages available at the present time, but
the 64-bit version represents the future direction for OS X and for fink;
individual users must make this decision on their own.  It will <em>not</em>
be possible to "upgrade" from 32-bit to 64-bit (or vice versa), without
completely reinstalling fink.
</p><p>
At the moment, two methods are available for installing Fink on Snow Leopard.
A binary installer is not available, so it is important to
<em>first install XCode from the Optional Installs folder on the Snow
Leopard disk.</em>
Users wanting the 64-bit version, or users upgrading directly from 10.4 or
earlier, must bootstrap fink from the distribution tarball (version
0.29.9 or later), available at <link
url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/fink/files/fink/0.29.9/fink-0.29.9.tar.gz/download">sourceforge.net</link>; installation instructions are
<varlink url="download/srcdist.php">here</varlink>.
On the other hand, users can upgrade directly from
10.5 to the 32-bit version, following the instructions below.
(One warning: users who have installed a development version of fink
from CVS rather than a released version may encounter trouble; please
downgrade your fink to a released version, and remove stray .deb files
of higher versions, before beginning.)
</p><p>
To upgrade, follow a four step process.
<em>Step 1:</em> edit the file <code>/sw/etc/fink.conf</code>,
adding a line to it which reads <code>NoAutoIndex: true</code>  (You may
need to use <code>sudo</code> to obtain the correct permissions to edit
this file.)  <em>Step 2:</em> 
run the command <code>fink reinstall fink</code> in
order to tell fink that you are now on 10.6.  (If you encounter a message
about package database corruption, run <code>fink index -f</code> and
try this step again.)  <em>Step 3:</em> 
run the command <code>fink update
fink</code> to get the latest fink for 10.6.  <em>Step 4:</em> run the command
<code>fink install perl588-core</code> to replace the version of perl
which Apple changed during the OS X upgrade, in case you have 
fink packages which depend on it.
</p><p>After the upgrade, you may wish to run <code>fink configure</code>
to do some cleanup.
</p><p>Almost all of the packages in fink's stable tree will compile on
10.6, but be warned that only a fraction of the 10.5 packages are currently
available for 10.6.  In the near future, fink's package database will be
updated to include information about packages for 10.6; you can check there
to see if your favorite package is ready.

The Fink Core Group announces two new members: Alexander Hansen (<em>akh</em>)
and Augusto Devegili (<em>monipol</em>), both of whom have been very active

</p><p>
The Group also announces that Christian Schaffner has stepped down,
returning to "ordinary member" status.  We thank Christian for his help
on the team over the past several years.
</p><p>
Members of the Fink project are working hard to provide user support,

    <body>
      <p>
The Fink project is no longer able to offer support for users of Fink
on Mac OS X 10.3. In reality there has been very little support for
some time, so this announcement simply formalizes that fact.
</p><p>
This means that there will not be any further updates, not even
security updates, for Mac OS X 10.3 users. Their existing
installations will continue to work, but the software that is
installed will not be updated.
</p><p>
We believe that the majority of our users are using Mac OS X 10.4 or
10.5 and hope that this does not inconvenience too many people.

    <headline>Mass package migration.</headline>
    <body>
      <p>
The massive GNOME update which has been in process for
many months was merged into fink's unstable tree.  This is well
tested, and updates by users appear to be going fairly smoothly.
</p><p>
We are now merging the gnome update into the stable tree.  Because
we have been unable to test the dependencies of these new packages in
the stable tree in advance, users can expect the "stable" tree to be
"not so stable" during the next few weeks, while the bugs get worked
out.
</p><p>
If you are eager to start using this massive gnome update immediately,
we suggest that you switch to the unstable tree.  If not, we suggest
that you hold off running "fink selfupdate" for a while (perhaps a
week or two) until things have again stabilized.</p>

    <headline>New Fink release.</headline>
    <body>
      <p>
A new (binary) Fink release for OS X 10.5 (Leopard) is 
<varlink url="download/index.php">available</varlink>
 today: version 0.9.0, which can be installed on either Intel or PowerPC
hardware.
The release includes source files, binary packages, and  Fink
installers for both kinds of hardware.
</p>
      <p>
Users who have already installed Fink on Leopard from source, who now wish
to switch to the binary distribution, may do so as follows.  First,
run <code>fink selfupdate</code> to update to the latest version of the
fink package manager.  Next, run <code>fink configure</code>, and be sure
to <em>change</em> your choice about using the binary distribution from No
to yes.  Finally, run <code>fink scanpackages</code> to activate the binary
distribution.
</p>
<p><em>Update, 2008-07-11:</em> If you use the binary installer, you
should run <code>fink selfupdate</code> after installation.</p>

	<headline>Mirror, mirror on the wall, will someone sponsor Fink at all?</headline>
	<body>
		<p>
Every large open source project has to face the problem of distribution and Fink is no different. We want you to get all the files you need to build your favourite application as quickly as possible. A mirror close to your location is a first step to achieving that. 
</p>
		<p>
We are actively working on building a reliable distribution infrastructure consisting of mirrors sponsored by universities and corporations. 
Recently our list of mirrors had to be shortened considerably and we need your <em>help</em> to improve its level of quality again.
</p>
	<p>
Are you a student? Are you a professor? Do you run a Data Center? Are you a developer with free time to spare? Even if you cannot say yes to any of those questions you still might be able to help.
All the relevant information on how to run and sponsor a mirror can be found on the <link url="http://wiki.finkproject.org/index.php/Fink:FinkMirrors">FinkWiki</link>.
For specific questions you can <link url="mailto:fink-core-private@lists.sourceforge.net">contact us</link> directly.
We are looking for mirrors all over the world, but specifically in these countries:</p>
<ul><li>United States</li><li>Japan</li><li>Germany</li><li>France</li><li>United Kingdom</li><li>Canada</li><li>Italy</li><li>Spain</li><li>Switzerland</li><li>Australia</li></ul>
	<p>
We would like to take this opportunity to thank those who are already providing Fink with mirrors. Without your continued support Fink would not be able to provide the level of service it currently does. Thank you!

    <p>Le projet Fink annonce le commencement du support pour Leopard (Mac OS X 10.5).</p>
<p>Les utilisateurs de 10.5 démarrant une nouvelle arborescence Fink devront le faire via bootstrap, tant qu'une distribution binaire ne sera pas disponible. <link url="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/fink/fink-0.27.7.tar.gz">Téléchargez la version 0.27.7 de Fink</link>.</p>
<p>La mise à jour de 10.4 vers 10.5 pour Fink peut s'effectuer en exécutant la commande <code>fink selfupdate</code> pour installer fink-0.27.7. Si vous êtes déjà sous 10.5, vérifiez d'abord que Xcode 3.0 est installé. Une fois 10.5 installé, exécutez ensuite <code>fink reinstall fink</code>.</p>
<p>La mise à jour de 10.3 vers 10.5 n'est pas encore prête. Si vous êtes impatient(e), vous devrez alors démarrer une nouvelle arborescence via bootstrap avec <code>fink-0.27.7</code>.</p>
<p><em>Actualisé le 29 octobre:</em> Attention, pour les utilisateurs qui installent la mise à jour Leopard, exécuter la commande <code>fink cleanup</code> supprimera <em>l'ensemble</em> de vos fichiers .deb. La prochaine version de Fink corrigera ce problème.</p>

<headline>Serveur inacessible - Solutions</headline>
<body>
<p><em>Mise à jour du 21/08/2006 </em> : le serveur est de nouveau accessible.</p>
<p>Le serveur qui héberge quatre services fink important (mise à jour via rsync, distribution binaire, "serveur maître" des fichiers sources et base de données des paquets) est inaccessible en ce moment. Nous espérons qu'il sera de nouveau fonctionnel lundi 21 août. Voici les solutions provisoires à votre disposition pendant l'indisponibilité du serveur.</p>
<p>Pour mettre à jours fink, vous devez soit choisir un miroir rsync différent du miroir primaire (voir le paragraphe suivant, soit utilisez la commmande <code>fink selfupdate-cvs</code>. Cette commande ne doit être utilisée qu'une seule fois ; les mises à jour suivantes se feront automatiquement via CVS. Quand le serveur sera de nouveau fonctionnel, vous pourrez revenir à la mise à jour via rsync en exécutant la commande <code>fink selfupdate-rsync</code>.</p>
<p>Pour pallier l'absence de distribution binaire et celle du "serveur primaire" des fichiers sources, exécutez la commande <code>fink configure</code>. Acceptez les réponses par défaut à toutes les questions, sauf à celles-ci: "Fink doit-il télécharger les paquets pré-compilés de la distribution binaire s'ils existent ?" (en anglais "Should Fink try to download pre-compiled packages from the binary distribution if available?"). Répondez alors "no" (en français "non") pour désactiver la distribution binaire. "Voulez-vous changer les miroirs ?" (en anglais "Do you want the change the mirror settings?"). Répondez "yes" (en français "oui"). "Dans quel ordre les miroirs doivent-ils être utilisés pour le téléchargement des sources ?" (en anglais ("What mirror order should fink use when downloading sources?". Répondez "2: Search Master Mirrors last" (en français "2 : Rechercher sur les miroirs maîtres en dernier lieu") pour désactiver l'utilisation automatique du serveur miroir maître). Enfin, si vous décidez de continuer à faire les mises à jour via rsync, vous devez choisir un autre miroir que rsync://master.us.finkmirrors.net/finkinfo/ en réponse à la question "Choisissez un miroir pour 'les mises à jour rsync'" (en anglais "Choose a mirror for 'RSync SelfUpdate'". Malheureusement, il se peut qu'aucun autre choix ne vous soit possible si vous habitez aux États-Unis.</p>
<p>Enfin, pour utiliser la base de données des paquets pendant la période d'indisponibilité du serveur, connectez-vous à <link url="http://pdb.finkproject.org/pdb/">cette copie de sauvegarde de la base de données des paquets</link>. Sachez, toutefois, qu'elle a quelques semaines de retard.</p>

<headline>Rappel : l'arborescence "10.4-transitional" ne sera plus gérée au 1er août 2006</headline>
<body>
<p>L'arborescence "10.4-transitional" fut créée pour résoudre de façon provisoire les incompatibilités entre binaires construits à partir de GCC 3.3 (le compilateur par défaut du système Mac OS X 10.3) et GCC 4.0 (le compilateur par défaut du système Mac OS X 10.4). À présent que Fink utilise GCC 4.0, l'arborescence "10.4-transitional" sera gelée à partir du 1er août 2006. Seule l'arborescence "10.4" sera gérée à partir de cette date.</p>
<p><em>Si la commande "fink --version" a pour résultat "0.8.1.cvs" ou "0.8.1.rsync", vous n'avez rien à faire.</em></p>
<p>Comme nous l'avons déjà écrit <varlink url="news/#2006-07-01%20July%20is%20%22Fink%20Update%20Month%22">précédemment</varlink>, il y a deux façcons de passer à l'arborescence "10.4".</p>
<p>Le moyen le plus simple est de supprimer l'installation de Fink et d'en récréer une nouvelle en utilisant l'installeur 0.8.1 disponible sur la <varlink url="download">page de téléchargement</varlink>.</p>
<p>Un autre moyen consiste à télécharger le <link url="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/fink/scripts-10.4-update-0.4.tar.gz?download">script de mise à jour</link> et de lire les instructions dans le fichier README pour mettre à jour l'installation existante sans la supprimer. Cette méthode reconstruit l'installation Fink à partir du source et met à jour toute l'installation. Notez que le processus peut prendre un certain temps selon l'installation.</p>
<p>Nous avons reçu des rapports très encourageants sur l'utilisation du script ; de nombreux utilisateurs sont déjà passés à la nouvelle arborescence. Si vous rencontrez des problèmes, veuillez en faire part sur les <varlink url="lists">listes de discussions</varlink>.

<headline>Juillet, "mois de mise à jour de Fink"</headline>
<body>
<p>Les utilisateurs de Fink sur machines PowerPc qui utilisent l'arborescence "10.4-transitional" doivent passer à l'arborescence "10.4". Nous avons prévu de geler l'arborescence 10.4-transitional à la fin du mois de Juillet.</p>
<p>Historique : le système Mac OS X 10.4 a introduit une nouvelle version du compilateur g++ (l'une des bêtes de somme de Fink). Cette version du compilateur produit du code incompatible avec les versions précédentes du compilateur. Dans l'arborescence 10.4-transitional, Fink mélange du code produit par le nouveau compilateur gcc-4.0 et du code produit par l'ancien compilateur g++-3.3. Cette stratégie a permis de dégager du temps pour rendre les paquets compatibles avec le compilateur g++-4.0. L'heure est maintenant venue de clore cette période transitoire et de ne plus utiliser que la nouvelle arborescence. Néanmoins, la mise à jour est compliquée du fait que tous les paquets qui utilisent ou fournissent des librairies g++ doivent être recompilés dans un certain ordre.</p>
<p>Si vous utilisez Mac OS X 10.4, vous pouvez déterminer si vous devez faire cette mise à jour en exécutant la commande <code>fink --version</code>. Si la version de distribution est la version "0.8.1.cvs" ou "0.8.1.rsync", vous <em>n'avez pas besoin</em> de faire la mise à jour. Mais si la version de distribution est la version "0.8.0.cvs" ou "0.8.0.rsync", vous <em>devez</em> effectuer la mise à jour comme décrit ci-dessous.</p>
<p>Certains utilisateurs préfèreront supprimer leur installation fink et réinstaller une nouvelle distribution avec l'installeur 0.8.1. D'autres préfèreront utiliser le <link url="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/fink/scripts-10.4-update-0.4.tar.gz?download">paquet de mise à jour 10.4 (v. 0.4)</link> (environ 12 Mo), qui comprend des versions précompilées des paquets de base de fink ainsi qu'un script de mise à jour de l'installation existante. Voir les instructions détaillées dans le fichier README qui se trouve dans le répertoire 10.4-update après décompression du paquet.</p>
<p>Note : les utilisateurs de Fink qui passent du système Mac OS X 10.3 au système Mac OS X 10.4 peuvent utiliser les mêmes procédures : soit supprimer complètement leur installation de fink et réinstaller une nouvelle distribution, soit utiliser le paquet le mise à jour 10.4. Le script de mise à jour ne doit pas être exécuté avant d'avoir mis à jour Mac OS X.</p>

<headline>Nouvelle version de Fink</headline>
<body>
<p>Aujourd'hui, une nouvelle version de Fink pour Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) a été <varlink url="download/index.php">postée</varlink>. C'est la version 0.8.1 qui peut être installée soit sur architecture Intel, soit sur architecture PowerPC. Cette version inclut les fichiers sources, les paquets binaires et les installeurs Fink pour les deux types d'architecture.</p>
<p>Fink sur architecture Intel est toujours considéré comme étant en phase &quot;bêta&quot;. Un grand nombre de paquets (en particulier les paquets de l'arborescence instable) soit ne compilent pas, soit compilent mais ne marchent pas. Nous travaillons à améliorer la situation.</p>
<p>Les utilisateurs de Fink sur architecture PowerPC qui utilisent déjà l'arborescence 10.4-transitional à partir de la distribution 0.8.0 peuvent mettre à jour Fink de deux manières différentes. Le processus de mise à jour n'est pas simple en raison des changements dans l'ABI des librairies g++; cela implique de recompiler de nombreuses librairies. La plupart des utilisateurs préfèreront sans supprimer leur installation de fink et repartir de zéro à partir de l'installeur 0.8.1. D'autres préfèreront utiliser le nouveau <link url="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/fink/scripts-10.4-update-0.3.tar.gz?download">paquet de mise à jour pour 10.4 (v. 0.3)</link> (environ 12 Mo), qui inclut des versions précompilées des paquets de base de fink ainsi qu'un script qui tentera de mettre à jour l'installation de fink en place.</p>

<headline>Problèmes avec CVS</headline>
<body>
<p>Comme la plupart des utilisateurs de Fink ont pu s'en rendre compte, l'accès au serveur CVS de Fink sur sourceforge.net ne fonctionne pas correctement depuis le 30 mars. L'accès CVS anonyme n'a pas été mis à jour depuis cette date et, depuis quelques jours, les développeurs ne peuvent, eux non plus, mettre à jour CVS par quelque moyen que ce soit.</p>
<p>Il semblerait que les intentions de l'équipe de sourceforge (brièvement expliquées dans la <link url="http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php docid=2352&amp;group_id=1">page de statut de leur site</link>) soient de ne pas réactiver les anciens serveurs CVS dans leur forme antérieure. Cela va conduire à des perturbations pour les utilisateurs de Fink, mais, à l'heure actuelle, nous ne savons pas quelle forme elles vont prendre.</p>
<p>Nous recommandons aux utilisateurs de Fink de passer à la méthode de mise à jour via 'rsync' (en exécutant la commande 'fink selfupdate-rsync'). Cela permettra au moins d'avoir une installation de Fink mise à jour jusqu'au 7 mai. Si  une mise à jour complète via CVS s'avère impossible par la suite avec la commande normale fink selfupdate, nous indiquerons ici comment effectuer la mise à jour lorsqu'elle sera disponible.</p>
<p>Mise à jour du 24/05/2006 : CVS fonctionne de nouveau. Les utilisateurs de la méthode de mise à jour via rsync obtiendront automatiquement les dernières mises à jour. Ceux qui utilisent la méthode de mise à jour via cvs et ne peuvent (ou ne veulent) passer à la méthode rsync doivent télécharger le fichier <code>fink-mirrors-0.24.15.2.tar.gz</code> situé sur la <link url="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=17203&amp;package_id=69685">page de téléchargement du fichier sur Sourceforge</link>, décompresser ce fichier et exécuter la commande <code>./inject.pl</code> à partir du répertoire <code>fink-mirrors-0.24.15.2</code>. Ensuite, la commande <code>fink selfupdate</code> devrait fonctionner comme auparavant.</p>

<headline>Problème engendré par la dernière mise à jour de sécurité d'Apple 2006-001</headline>
<body>
<p>On a rapporté à l'équipe Fink des problèmes avec le programme <code>rsync</code>, programme qui a été modifié par la dernière mise à jour de sécurité d'Apple 2006-001. Certains utilisateurs ne peuvent plus exécuter <code>fink selfupdate</code> après la mise à jour de sécurité. La cause semble être un problème avec l'option <code>--delete</code> de <code>rsync</code>.</p>
<p>L'une des solutions est d'exécuter <code>fink install rsync</code> pour utiliser le paquet rsync de fink au lieu du programme d'Apple. Pour les utilisateurs qui ont besoin des fonctionnalités spécifiques du programme d'Apple (telle la gestion des attributs étendus), la solution est d'exécuter <code>fink selfupdate-cvs</code> pour passer à la mise à jour via cvs.</p>
<p>Mise à jour 13/03/2006 : le problème a été résolu par la mise à jour de sécurité 2006-002, <link url="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=303453">comme indiqué dans la documentation d'Apple</link>.

<headline>Version initiale de Fink sur Intel</headline>
<body>
<p>Une première version de Fink pour l'architecture Intel est maintenant prête. Il n'existe pas encore de paquets binaires, et tout n'est pas encore peaufiné, mais elle est utilisable pour ceux qui ont de la patience.</p>
<p>Pour l'installer, vous devez d'abord installer au minimum les paquets compilateur et SDK de Xcode. Ensuite vous devez télécharger le fichier <code>fink-0.24.14.tar.gz</code> à partir de <link url="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=17203&amp;package_id=13043">la page de distribution de Fink sur SourceForge</link>, le décompresser et exécuter la commande <code>./bootstrap.sh</code>. Quand l'amorçage sera terminé, exécutez <code>fink selfupdate</code> ; vous obtiendrez ainsi les paquets actuellement disponibles.</p>
<p>Aux dernières nouvelles, il y avait environ 1 750 paquets dans l'arborescence "stable", mais 150 d'entre eux échouaient à la compilation. Quand tout sera vraiment stable, nous l'annoncerons ici.</p>

<headline>Fink est prêt pour XCode 2.2 (mais par pour Intel).</headline>
<body>
<p>Fink est maintenant prêt pour XCode 2.2, à l'exception des paquets openoffice.org (nous espérons qu'ils fonctionneront de nouveau quand nous passerons à l'arborescence 10.4). Nous encourageons les utilisateurs à passer à la version 2.2 de XCode s'ils le désirent ; XCode 2.2 devra être installé quand l'arborescence 10.4 sera mise à disposition.</p>
<p>D'un autre côté et malgré l'annonce qu'Apple a faite aujourd'hui, Fink n'est pas prêt à tourner sur des processeurs Intel. L'équipe de Fink espère avoir une version prête pour Intel dans quelques semaines ; nous suggérons aux heureux bénéficiaires d'un nouvel iMac de ne pas y installer Fink tout de suite, mais d'attendre que la nouvelle version de Fink soit prête.</p>
<p>Les mainteneurs de paquets Fink doivent tenir compte du nouveau champ <code>Architecture</code>, dont l'usage est expliqué dans le guide d constructions de paquets.</p>

<headline>Nouvelles versions Fink</headline>
<body>
<p>Trois nouvelles versions de Fink sont <varlink url="download/index.php">disponibles</varlink> aujourd'hui : la version 0.8.0 (pour Mac OS X 10.4), la version 0.7.2 (pour Mac OS X 10.3) et la version 0.6.4 (pour Mac OS X 10.2). Les trois versions comprennent les fichiers sources, les paquets binaires et un installeur Fink pour les nouveaux utilisateurs.</p>
<p>La nouvelle version pour Mac OS X 10.4 inclut tous les paquets &quot;stable&quot; actuellement disponibles sous forme source et sous forme binaire. C'est-à-dire 1 565 paquets, ce qui constitue plus de 80 % des 1 909 paquets disponibles dans la version pour Mac OS X 10.3. Les développeurs de Fink continuent à porter les paquets stables sur Tiger.</p>
<p>La nouvelle version pour Mac OS X 10.2 est la dernière version officielle pour ce système. Bien qu'il n'y aura plus de mises à jour fournies par l'équipe Fink - y compris de mises à jour de sécurité -, nous estimons que la version 0.6.4 devrait fonctionner tout à fait correctement pour quelques années encore.</p>
<p>Les utilisateurs qui passent de la version 10.3 à la version 10.4 par mise à jour n'ont qu'à exécuter <code>fink selfupdate</code>, suivi de <code>sudo /sw/lib/fink/postinstall.pl</code> (pour les personnes qui passent au système 10.4 pour la première fois), de <code>fink scanpackages</code> et de <code>sudo apt-get update</code>. Nous vous recommandons de ne pas utiliser l'amorçage pour le moment, car il ne fonctionne pas avec la nouvelle version 2.1 de Xcode d'Apple.</p>
<p>Note ajoutée le 19/06/2005 : si l'installeur binaire Fink-0.8.0 signale que le volume ne gère pas les liens symboliques, lancez l'Utilitaire de disque (situé dans le répertoire Utilitaires du dossier Applications), sélectionnez le volume en cause et cliquez sur "Réparez les autorisations du disque". L'installeur ne peut fonctionner que si vous avez des droits d'administrateur, assurez-vous donc que vous le faites tourner sous un utilisateur qui possèdent ces droits.</p>
<p>Note ajoutée le 30/06/2005 : pour éviter des problèmes avec d'anciens headers ou fichiers, nous recommandons aux personnes qui souhaitent construire les paquets à partir des sources de faire une installation propre de Xcode à l'aide du script <code>/Developer/Tools/uninstall-devtools.pl</code>. Il est préférable de le faire avant de mettre à jour le système.</p>

<headline>Fink et Tiger</headline>
<body>
<p>Fink fonctionnne sous Mac OS X 10.4 ! Voici les différentes façons de faire la mise à jour :</p>
<ul>
<li>Un installeur binaire sera disponible d'ici quelques semaines pour les utilisateurs de binaires. D'ici là, les nouveaux utilisateurs peuvent amorcer l'installation de la version 0.23.10 de fink, comme expliqué ci-dessous aux utilisateurs de la branche stable.</li>
<li>Nous recommandons aux utilisateurs de la branche stable de supprimer fink en utilisant la commande <code>sudo rm -Rf /sw</code>, puis d'amorcer l'installation de la version 0.23.10 de fink avec le fichier compressé <link url="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=17203&amp;package_id=13043&amp;release_id=326600">fink-0.23.10.tar.gz</link>. Téléchargez ce fichier et décompressez-le via la commande <code>tar -xvzf fink-0.23.10.tar.gz</code>. Exécutez ensuite la commande <code>./bootstrap.sh</code> dans le répertoire <filename>fink-0.23.10</filename> nouvellement créé. Enfin, lancez la commande <code>fink selfupdate</code>.</li>
<li>Les utilisateurs de la branche instable peuvent faire la mise à jour via <code>fink selfupdate</code> si leur version de fink est inférieure à la version 0.24.6. Elle sera alors installée. Après passage à la version 10.4 de Mac OS X, vérifiez d'abord que vous avez la bonne version de fink en exécutant <code>fink --version</code>. Si la version est inférieure à 0.24.6, lancez <code>fink selfupdate</code>. Que vous ayez ou non exécuté la commande <code>fink selfupdate</code>, réinstallez ensuite le paquet fink via la commande <code>fink rebuild fink</code>, suivie de <code>fink selfupdate</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tous les paquets ne fonctionnent pas encore sous Mac OS X 10.4, mais la situation va s'améliorer au fil des semaines. La branche stable contient, à l'heure actuelle, nettement moins de paquets que sous Mac OS X 10.3, mais tous ceux qui sont présents devraient compiler sans problèmes.</p>
<p>Il reste bien sûr quelques petits défauts à corriger. Nous recommandons aux utilisateurs, dont le travail dépend du bon fonctionnement de certaines applications, de vérifier sur les listes de diffusion si les applications en question ont été testées avant de faire la mise à jour.</p>

Cette mise à jour résout les problèmes du compilateur gcc3 dans XCode 1.5. Si vous utilisez ce dernier, vous devez installer la mise à jour. Elle s'effectuera correctement, que vous ayez ou non installé précédemment la solution recommandée par Fink.</p>

<p>Il s'avère que la version de gcc incluse dans XCode 1.5 produit des résultats incorrects avec du code C++ dans certains cas. Fink possède maintenant un mécanisme pour en avertir l'utilisateur et refusera bientôt d'utiliser cette version &quot;vérolée&quot; pour compiler les paquets qui présentent ce problème.</p>
<p>Si vous êtes déjà passé à la version 1.5 de XCode, vous trouverez une solution décrite <link url="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.os.apple.fink.beginners/13580">ici</link> ou <link url="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.os.apple.fink.beginners/14200">là</link>.</p>

<p>La dernière version de Fink, 0.7.1 (pour 10.3) est maintenant disponible sous forme de sources ou de binaires. Cette tourne sur les versions Panther (10.3) de Mac OS X. La version 0.6.3 reste disponible pour les utilisateurs des versions Jaguar (10.2) de Mac OS X.</p>
<p>Elle intégre diverses corrections du gestionnaire de paquets. De plus, de nombreux paquets, auparavant indisponibles sous forme binaire, ont été ajoutés, ce qui porte le total des binaires disponibles à 1650. Ils comprennent, en autres, les binaires de KDE 3.1.4 et ceux de GNOME 2.4.</p>
<p>Pour installer Fink pour la première fois, veuillez suivre les instructions données <varlink url="download/index.php?phpLang=fr">ici</varlink>. Pour mettre à jour Fink, servez-vous de la version installée sur votre système. Vous trouverez la liste des différences entre les versions 0.7.0 et 0.7.1 sur cette <link url="http://pdb.finkproject.org/pdb/compare.php?tree1=0.7.1-stable&amp;cmp=0&amp;tree2=0.7.0-stable&amp;splitoffs=on&amp;sort=name">page.</link></p>
<p>Si vous vous posez des questions ou rencontrez des difficultés, n'hésitez pas à vous servir des listes de diffusion de Fink. Vous en trouverez le détail <varlink url="lists/index.php?phpLang=fr">ici</varlink>.</p>
<p>Vérifiez que vous avez choisi le <em>bon installeur</em> pour votre plate-forme. Fink 0.6.3 n'est installable que sur Mac OS X 10.2.*, tandis que Fink 0.7.1 ne convient que pour Mac OS X 10.3.*.</p>
<p>L'équipe Fink remercie toutes les personnes sans lesquelles cette version n'aurait pas vu le jour : ses nombreux contributeurs, toutes les personnes qui apportent leur aide régulièrement ainsi que les développeurs. Nous remercions aussi notre communauté d'avoir téléchargé la version 0.7.0 précédente plus de 130 000 fois.

<p>Bonne année à tous de la part de toute l'équipe.</p>
<p>L'année passée a été une bonne année pour Fink. Nous avons eu du mal à intégrer les changements introduits par Apple, mais nous avons aussi découvert que nous avions une communauté formidable prête à patienter très longtemps pour nous soutenir. C'est pourquoi nous vous disons &quot;Merci&quot;. Le projet Fink avance principalement grâce au soutien et aux encouragements extraordinaires que nous recevons de nos utilisateurs.</p>
<p>En 2004, la tendance devrait s'accélérer. Il y a quelques petites choses intéressantes en vue : GNOME 2.4, une nouvelle version de KDE, des changements majeurs dans le gestionnaire de paquets, et une restructuration de l'organisation. Nous espérons pouvoir étendre le projet par des conférences développeurs, des rencontres et un CD dans votre magasin préféré.</p>
<p>Les grandes ambitions peuvent se révéler catastrophiques, c'est pourquoi nous les réaliserons en douceur, mais nous comptons toujours sur votre soutien cette année.

<p>Merci, merci, merci ! Quelle formidable communauté ! Merci de nous offrir toujours plus de sites miroirs. </p>
<p>Matthew Healey, membre du Western <link url="http://www.wamug.org.au"> Australian</link>
Macintosh User Group, et son fournisseur d'accès <link url="http://www.extremedsl.com.au">
extremedsl</link> nous offrent un miroir complet à Perth, en Australie. Il s'agit de notre premier miroir à l'autre bout du monde, je suis donc d'autant plus heureux de l'accueillir dans notre famille. Le service <link url="http://www.mirror.ac.uk">UKMIRROR</link> nous a, par ailleurs, accepté, rendant les distributions de Fink disponibles sur 21 serveurs à charge partagée. </p>
<p>Nous en sommes très heureux, mais nous sommes toujours à la recherche de nouveaux miroirs basés sur rsync. Si vous désirez nous aider, allez sur <link url="http://finkmirrors.net">finkmirrors.net</link> et entrez contact avec nous. </p>

<headline>Un autre miroir.... Mais est-ce bien suffisant ?</headline>
<body>
<p>Nous souhaitons la bienvenue à notre nouveau miroir situé en Norvège, sponsorisé par Havar Valeur, mais nous faisons encore appel à votre générosité. Pour améliorer le service qui vous est destiné, nous vous demandons de bien vouloir regarder si vous ne pourriez pas devenir miroir. </p>
<p>Il suffit de posséder un lien à 10 Mbit/s, environ 100 Mo d'espace disque disponible et de la bande passante à partager avec Fink. Les instructions précises pour la mise en place de rsync sont disponibles <link url="http://finkmirrors.net/rsync.html">ici</link>. Nous recherchons, en particulier, des miroirs en Asie, en Australie, en Nouvelle Zélande, en Europe méridionale et en Europe centrale : nous n'en avons encore aucun dans ces régions. Si vous vous sentez d'humeur particulièrement généreuse et désirez faire davantage, allez sur <link url="http://finkmirrors.net">finkmirrors.net</link> pour découvrir les options qui s'offrent à vous. </p>
<p>Vous pouvez connaître, à tout instant, l'état de nos miroirs rsync sur finkmirrors.net. Nous comptons améliorer ce service par la suite, ce qui ne pourra être fait que grâce à la bonne volonté de chacun. Nous pensons à de nombreuses autres applications et remercions d'avance l'ensemble de notre communauté. </p>

<headline>Fink 0.6.2 est disponible</headline>
<body>
<p>Les binaires et sources de la dernière version de Fink, numérotée 0.6.2, sont maintenant disponibles. Il s'agit d'une version destinée à corriger deux bogues de la version précédente : celui de la suppression utilisateur / dselect, ainsi qu'un problème d'autorisations attribuées aux fichiers. Le bogue dselect a été résolu en mettant à jour les paquets fink, dpkg et apt. Après mise à jour en version 0.6.2, vous pourrez utiliser de nouveau dselect sans problème. Cependant, si vous avez utilisé dselect sous une version au moins égale à la version 0.6.0, vérifiez l'intégrité du fichier <code>/sw/etc/apt/sources.list</code>. Si vous avez le moindre doute concernant ce fichier, nous vous recommandons de le remplacer par <varlink url="files/sources.list">le fichier sources.list par défaut</varlink>. </p>
<p>Les utilisateurs qui ont installé des fichiers binaires à partir de la distribution 0.6.1 pourraient constater que certains fichiers Fink appartiennent à l'utilisateur UID 20011 et non à l'utilisateur root. Pour corriger ce problème, lancez la commande :</p>
<codeblock>
sudo find /sw/ -user 2011 -exec chown root:admin {} \;
</codeblock>
<p>Cette version, comme la précédente, a été créée sous Mac OS X 10.2 et compilée avec gcc 3.3. Elle fonctionne correctement, à quelques exceptions* près, sous Mac OS X 10.3. La plupart des utilisateurs passant sous Mac OS X 10.3 devront utiliser les binaires de cette nouvelle distribution pour l'instant, tandis que l'équipe de Fink continue d'adapter les paquets Fink à Mac OS X 10.3. </p>
<p>*Quelques exceptions : emacs, qt. </p>

<headline>Risque de suppression d'utilisateur / Problèmes avec Dselect</headline>
<body>
<p><em>En bref : N'UTILISEZ PAS DSELECT</em>, et si vous avez eu le malheur de le faire, vérifiez, dès maintenant, le contenu de votre fichier /sw/etc/apt/sources.list.</p>
<p>Les utilisateurs qui ont fait un bootstrap ou installé Fink 0.5.3 ou Fink 0.6.0 sous Mac OS X 10.3 pourraient rencontrer un problème majeur : tous les utilisateurs pourraient être effacés de la base netinfo, rendant l'ouverture de session impossible. Nous pensons que ce problème ne survient que lors de l'utilisation de dselect.</p>
<p>Si vous utilisez Mac OS X 10.3, procédez à l'installation de la toute dernière version de Fink pour éviter une telle déconvenue. Pour vous assurer que vous n'avez pas de problème de mise à jour rampant, vérifiez le contenu du fichier <code>/sw/etc/apt/sources.list</code>. Vous devrez le modifier s'il contient des lignes commençant par <code>deb</code> et pointant vers "release" ou "current" sans numéro de version spécifié. En d'autres termes, si votre fichier <code>sources.list</code> contient des lignes semblables aux lignes suivantes :</p>
<codeblock>
deb http://us.dl.sourceforge.net/fink/direct_download release main 
deb http://us.dl.sourceforge.net/fink/direct_download current main
</codeblock>
<p>vous devrez les modifier comme suit :</p>
<codeblock>
deb http://us.dl.sourceforge.net/fink/direct_download 10.3/release main 
deb http://us.dl.sourceforge.net/fink/direct_download 10.3/current main
</codeblock>
<p>Nous travaillons à la mise à jour du référentiel pour éviter la diffusion de code incorrect à la suite d'une mise à jour. Nous sommes en train de corriger le bogue de dselect mais, en attendant, vérifiez le contenu du fichier <code>sources.list</code>.</p>
<p>D'autres utilisateurs ont eu des problèmes avec dselect ; celui-ci prévient de l'absence d'un paquet "darwin". Si vous lancez dselect sous Mac OS X 10.3 et si vous <em>NE VOYEZ PAS</em> un tel avertissement, alors votre fichier <code>sources.list</code> est probablement corrompu et doit être réparé comme expliqué plus haut. </p>

<headline>Fink 0.6.1 est disponible</headline>
<body>
<p>La dernière version de Fink, numérotée 0.6.1, est maintenant disponible sous forme de sources et de binaires. Cette version a été réalisée sous Mac OS X 10.2 et compilée avec gcc 3.3. Elle fonctionne correctement sous Mac OS X 10.3. La plupart des utilisateurs passant sous Mac OS X 10.3 devront utiliser les binaires de cette nouvelle distribution pour l'instant, tandis que l'équipe de Fink continue d'adapter les paquets Fink à Mac OS X 10.3.</p>
<p>Pour accéder aux nouveaux binaires, utiliser apt-get, dselect, ou le mode binaire de FinkCommander. A moins de vouloir aider l'équipe de Fink à tester des paquets compilés spécialement pour Mac OS X 10.3, n'utilisez pas l'outil <code>fink</code> pour réaliser des installations pendant les prochaines semaines. </p>
<p>Pour mettre à jour une installation binaire, la méthode la plus simple est de lancer "sudo apt-get update". Vous trouverez de plus amples informations sur la mise à jour de Fink sous Mac OS X 10.3, ainsi que sur les problèmes qu'elle soulève sur la <varlink url="download/10.3-upgrade.php">page spéciale de mise à jour Mac OS X 10.3.</varlink></p>
<p>Avant d'utiliser la dernière version de l'outil en ligne de commande <code>fink</code> sous Mac OS X 10.2, vérifiez que vous avez bien installé le paquet August2003gccUpdater, disponible sur connect.apple.com après enregistrement gratuit. </p>

<p>Nous souhaitons à tous de joyeuses fêtes d'Halloween. </p>
<p>Et bienvenue dans la famille Fink aux nouveaux miroirs. Basé à Rijeka, en Croatie, un nouveau miroir intégral nous a rejoint. Il a été sponsorisé par le groupe utilisateur Apple <link url="http://mac.dir.hr/">Jabucnjak</link>. Il s'agit de notre premier miroir en Europe, et gageons qu'il ne sera pas le dernier. </p>
<p>Dave Schroeder de l'<link url="http://mirror.services.wisc.edu/">Université du Wisconsin</link> à Madison sponsorise un serveur maître dédié sur une ligne à 100Mbit. A. J. Wright et <link url="http://sunsite.utk.edu/">SunSITE@UTK</link> nous aident à mettre en place un autre serveur intégral aux États-Unis. </p>
<p>Ce qui élève le nombre total de miroirs intégraux à 4 et le nombre de miroirs rsync à 5. Nous sommes heureux d'avoir une communauté si fantastique avec nous, mais je sais que nous ne sommes pas au bout du compte. Je ne cesserai de vous harceler jusqu'à ce que Fink possède au moins un miroir dans chaque état des États-Unis. Épaulé par une communauté d'exception, je ne suis pas trop inquiet. Je pense pouvoir atteindre très bientôt cet objectif. </p>
<p>Toc, toc, toc ! Comme les enfants le jour d'Halloween, nous frappons à votre porte et vous réclamons ... des miroirs. À votre bon coeur, administrateurs de réseaux, remplissez notre corbeille.

<p>Comme vous l'avez certainement remarqué, Fink possède un logo, choisi à la suite du <varlink url="logo.php">concours de logo</varlink> qui s'est tenu au début de cette année. Ce nouveau logo officiel est affiché depuis le 24 octobre.

<p>L'explication est accompagnée d'une reproduction du logo à plus grande échelle, ce qui permet d'en apprécier les détails. Notre nouveau logo nous plaît et nous espérons qu'il vous plaira aussi. </p>
<p>IMPORTANT: Nous ne possédons pas d'accord de licence en bonne et due forme pour le nouveau logo, nous sommes donc dans l'incapacité d'accorder la permission de le distribuer. Pour l'instant, il ne peut figurer que sur les pages du site internet de Fink. Merci de votre compréhension. </p>

<headline>Mise à jour gcc 3.3 et/ou Mac OS X 10.3</headline>
<body>
<p>Fink peut maintenant être mis à jour pour profiter du compilateur gcc 3.3, ou pour fonctionner sous Mac OS X 10.3, si cette dernière version est installée. Les paquets binaires correspondant à ces mises à jour ne sont, cependant, pas encore disponibles. Si vous faites un usage intensif des paquets binaires, il est peut-être préférable d'attendre quelques jours avant de procéder à la mise à jour. </p>
<p>La mise à jour des Developer Tools d'Apple d'août 2003 devra impérativement être appliquée AVANT de procéder à la mise à jour de Fink, si la dernière mise à jour des Developer Tools installée sur votre machine est datée de juin 2003. Sous Mac OS X 10.3, n'oubliez pas d'installer XCode à partir du CD XCode avant de procéder à la mise à jour de Fink. </p>
<p>Pour mettre à jour Fink, il vous suffit de lancer la commande "fink selfupdate". La dernière version du gestionnaire de paquets fink détecte automatiquement les versions de Mac OS X et de gcc installées et se comporte en conséquence. </p>
<p>Pour faire une installation complète de Fink sous Mac OS X 10.3, nous vous recommandons de <varlink url="download/srcdist.php">faire un bootstrap à partir des sources</varlink>, en utilisant l'archive fink-full-0.6.0.tar.gz disponible sur <link url="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=17203">la page des téléchargements de Fink</link> sur sourceforge. XCode doit être installé pour ce faire. </p>
<p>Notez qu'après installation de la version 0.15.0 de Fink, ou d'une version ultérieure, il n'est plus nécessaire d'installer le paquet system-xfree86. Fink peut déterminer automatiquement la version de system-xfree86 à utiliser, si vous n'avez encore aucun paquet X11 de fink installé. Si vous avez installé antérieurement un paquet system-xfree86, lancez la commande suivante : </p>
<codeblock>
sudo dpkg -r --force-all system-xfree86 system-xfree86-42 \ 
system-xfree86-43; fink selfupdate; fink index
</codeblock>
<p>L'équipe de Fink travaille sur l'adaptation des paquets à Mac OS X 10.3, mais la plupart d'entre eux fonctionnent déjà sur le nouveau système.</p>

<p>As announced in <link url="http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2003-21.html">this CERT

the ftp servers for GNU software were compromised back in March, 
although it is not believed that any of the source code housed there
was affected.</p><p>Fink relies on MD5 checksums when downloading software, and we have had
no reports of incorrect checksums in Fink packages.  The Free Software
Foundation is in the process of verifying the integrity of all of the
source code distributed from that ftp site.  As of this writing, the source
code for the following Fink packages have not yet been verified:
<code>autoconf2.54</code>,
<code>emacs21</code>,

<code>groff</code>,
<code>guile16</code>,
<code>help2man</code>,

<headline>Developer Tools Update.</headline>
 <body>
<p><em>Quick Summary: DO NOT INSTALL THIS UPDATE.</em></p>
 <p>Apple has released a patch to the December 2002 
Developer Tools which includes gcc 3.3,
their new compiler.</p><p>Fink does not yet support compiling with gcc 3.3.  In addition, it is important
not to "mix and match" between compilers:  all C++ code in fink packages
needs to be compiled
with the same compiler.</p><p>For this reason, the Fink team recommends that if you update your
Developer Tools with the new patch, you should be careful to run
<code>sudo gcc_select 3</code>
prior to any "fink build" or "fink install" commands.</p>
<p><em>Update 30 June 2003:</em> A 
<link url="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=2680195&amp;forum_id=2056">problem
has now been detected</link> with
the new assembler program which the update installs, which may prevent
certain Fink packages from being compiled at all if you install this
update.  </p>
<p><em>Generally, Fortran programs will break if you install the update;
the breakage does not stop by simply switching back to gcc 3.1.</em>
The Fink team is working on a workaround for this problem, but until it
is ready, if you need Fortran-related programs you should not install
the update.</p>

with future X11 releases.</p>
<p>Ben Hines has created a script (available <link url="http://fink.cvs.sourceforge.net/*checkout*/fink/fix-fink/install_name_fix.pl">here</link>) that you can use
that will fix the install_name entries in Apple's X11 libraries,
but it will not repair software you have already built against the
broken libraries.</p>
<p><em>Update 11 February 2003:</em> This script is not needed with 
version 0.2 of Apple's X11.app which was released yesterday.</p>

<headline>Gnome, libpng, and the unstable tree</headline>
<body>
<p>A problem was uncovered today concerning the versions of imlib,
 libpng, and gnome in Fink's unstable tree.  The Fink team is hard at
 work addressing this problem.  As a workaround, users can downgrade
their imlib package to the stable version, "<code>fink install
 imlib-1.9.10-9</code>", until the problem is fixed.</p><p>Many Fink users may be using Fink's unstable tree without being
fully aware of what this entails.  For a few months in the fall,
enabling the unstable tree was the only way to gain access to
 10.2-compatible versions of Fink packages.  
<em>That is no longer the case.</em>
Fink users who do not wish to help the Fink team with testing should
disable their unstable tree.  To do this, edit the file
<code>/sw/etc/fink.conf</code> and remove the items
 <code>unstable/main</code> and <code>unstable/crypto</code> from the
 <code>Trees</code> line.</p>
<p>The Fink team appreciates those users who are willing to stick with
the unstable tree, even when there are problems like today's, and provide
the team with prompt feedback.  This is a community effort and we
appreciate your participation.</p>

<headline>Fink 0.5.0a Released</headline>
<body>
<p> Fink 0.5.0a for Mac OS X 10.2 is now complete. (Note: 0.5.0a is a final
 release, and replaces 0.5.0 which was never officially released.) This
 release includes over 700 
 binary packages for OS X 10.2 as well as over 1800 source packages of
 all kinds. </p>
<p>The source release and the binary installer are available now, as well as all binary packages. For information about upgrading, visit the <varlink url="download/upgrade.php">Upgrade Matrix</varlink>. </p>
<p>  This release is for Mac OS X 10.2 only. 10.1 users should use Fink 0.4.1.</p>

xfree86 packages, you should update to xfree86-base-4.2.1.1-1 and
xfree86-rootless-4.2.1.1-1.  These packages are recent additions to
the 10.2/unstable tree; to gain access to them, you may need to run

<headline>Don't reuse binary installer</headline>
<body>
<p>  Users are cautioned to use the binary installer for Fink 0.4.1 <em>only
once</em> on a given machine.  Due to an apparent bug in Apple's
Installer.app program, attempting a second installation on the same
machine can result in permissions being altered in the machine's root
directory, in some cases leaving the machine in a non-bootable state.</p><p> If Installer.app presents you with an "Upgrade" button rather
than an "Install" button when installing Fink 0.4.1, <em>do not proceed
any further!</em> </p>
<p>A new version of the binary installer for Fink 0.4.1 became available
on November 5.  The new version avoids
the problem of the machine not booting, but even with the new version,
users are advised to only "Install",
not "Upgrade."  (You can recognize the new version by its filesize of
12582912 bytes, while the old version had a filesize of 10541112 bytes.)</p></body></newsitem>

<p> At the same time, this release is not meant for Mac OS X 10.2. Fink 0.5.0. which is targeted for October, will be geared towards 10.2. In the meantime refer to the news item below on how to upgrade Fink for 10.2.</p>

<headline>Mac OS X 10.2 / Jaguar</headline>
<body>
<p>During the last few weeks, we got a lot of emails asking whether Fink will work Mac OS X 10.2.</p>
<p>The answer is: Yes, we will support 10.2. However, due to some
major changes in this new OS version, we had to make a lot of adjustments both
to the Fink tool itself and to many packages. The current binary distribution,
0.4.0a, will only work partially on 10.2. We are working on an upgrade guide,
as well as a new Fink release, to support 10.2.</p>
<p> If you upgrade your system to 10.2 before the official Fink update for 10.2 is ready,
 many Fink packages built on 10.1 are going to work fine, but others need to be rebuilt.
 Some packages need special changes to build on 10.2. Adding "unstable/main" to your
 list of trees in /sw/etc/fink.conf (see also the <varlink url="faq/usage-fink.php#unstable">FAQ</varlink>)
 will give you access to the latest versions of packages, many of which include important
 fixes for 10.2.</p>
<p>  As of now, please do not email us asking about 10.2 support. If you can't wait,
  consult the <varlink url="lists/index.php">mailing list archives</varlink> instead.</p>

<headline>Bug in passwd package</headline>
<body>
<p>All Fink users are urged to update their <em> passwd </em> package to version 20020329 or newer. Older versions of the <em> passwd </em> package are affected by a bug which could lead to the loss of all data on your hard disk if you remove system users created by Fink manually from the system via System Preferences. (Removing them via the NetInfo tool is safe.) You can check the version of your passwd package by entering <em> dpkg -s passwd</em>. If your version is outdated, you can update to the current one in two ways: </p>
<ul>
<li>
  Via the binary distribution. First make sure you have the latest list of packages available: <em> sudo apt-get update</em>. Then you can perform the actual update: <em> sudo apt-get install passwd</em>. 
</li>
<li>
  Via the source distribution. First make sure you have the latest set of package descriptions: <em> fink selfupdate-cvs</em>. Then, update the passwd package: <em> fink update passwd</em> 
</li>
</ul>
<p>See <varlink url="faq/usage-general.php#passwd">Fink's FAQ, question 6.3,</varlink> for more information about the passwd package. </p>
