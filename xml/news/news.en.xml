 <headline>fink-0.45.3 released</headline>
 <body>
  <p>The Fink Project has released fink-0.45.3. This is a minor behavioral fix for an issue introduced in 0.45.2. With this release, the default prefix for new installs is reverted to <code>/sw</code> for all macOS versions from 10.14 and earlier. Newer releases still default to <code>/opt/sw</code>. This will allow installs on macOS 10.14 and earlier to continue to use any available binary distributions. There are no other functional changes in this release compared to fink-0.45.2.</p>
  <p>This release does not yet support macOS 11 (Big Sur).</p>

 <body>
  <p>The Fink Project has released fink-0.45.2. This release provides support for all macOS releases up to and including 10.15.7. Most importantly, it changes the default install path location to <code>/opt/sw</code> for all supported macOS releases. This release also fixes bootstrapping problems when installing on macOS 10.15 with Xcode12. Run <code>fink selfupdate</code> to install the latest version. This release does not need any special preparation apart from those listed below if upgrading to macOS 10.15 from an earlier macOS release.</p>

 <headline>Further 10.15 (Catalina) and Xcode11 upgrade details</headline>
 <body>
  <p>If upgrading to macOS 10.15 (Catalina) from an earlier macOS release, your existing Fink install will cease to work if installed outside <code>/opt</code> (such as to the previous default <code>/sw</code>) and must be reinstalled from scratch using Fink release 0.45.0 or later.</p>
  <p>The old Fink install is archived into <code>/Users/Shared/Relocated Items</code>. It's possible to manually recover downloaded source archives and configuration files from there to use in a new Fink install. However, it's not possible to reuse built .deb packages because they hardcode the original path that contained Fink.</p>
  <p>Upgrade and installation hints if existing Fink install is outside <code>/opt</code>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If doing a fresh Fink install on any macOS version, install Fink into <code>/opt/sw</code>.</li>
    <li>If you haven't yet updated to macOS 10.15, run this command to capture the list of your currently installed packages: <code>for i in `/bin/ls -1 /sw/var/lib/dpkg/info/*.list`; do basename -s .list $i >> ~/my_fink_packages.txt; done</code>.</li>
    <li>If you have already updated to macOS 10.15 but had Fink installed somewhere outside <code>/opt</code> before your system upgrade, use the above command (with modified path to the "Relocated Items" location as necessary) to capture the packages you previously had installed on your older macOS release. For example: <code>for i in `/bin/ls -1 "/Users/Shared/Relocated Items/sw/var/lib/dpkg/info/"*.list`; do basename -s .list $i >> ~/my_fink_packages.txt; done</code></li>
    <li>Once you have captured your list of previous packages, upgraded to macOS 10.15, and installed Fink into <code>/opt</code>, run the following command to batch build and reinstall your previous Fink packages: <code>cat ~/my_fink_packages.txt | xargs fink reinstall</code>. Note that some packages do not exist on macOS 10.15, so you might need to hand edit the file <code>my_fink_packages.txt</code> to remove the missing packages before trying to reinstall.</li>
  </ul>

 <headline>10.15 (Catalina) and Xcode11 information</headline>
 <body>
  <p>Fink 0.45.0 and up support the upcoming 10.15 release, but there are some important things to note:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Apple locked down the <code>/ (root)</code> directory where Fink normally installs (in <code>/sw</code> by default), so existing Fink installs may become read-only upon updating to 10.15.</li>
    <li>Xcode11 introduces some known breakages (with no known fixes at this time) to important packages like gcc, so not everything will build yet.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Once macOS 10.15 is officially released, we suggest waiting to upgrade until we know how the system will treat existing installs and we can determine the best upgrade path.</p>
  <p>For anyone installing Fink for the first time (on 10.15beta or an earlier macOS version), we now recommend using <code>/opt/sw</code> as the install location, since that's known to work. The next Fink release after macOS 10.15 is out will use <code>/opt/sw</code> as the default install location.</p>
  <p>Xcode11 is known to currently break building the gccX and several other important packages. If possible (especially 10.14 users), hold off on upgrading to Xcode11 unless you need something specific from it. If you do upgrade to Xcode11, make sure that the Command Line Tools are also upgraded to version 11 for your macOS release.</p>

  <p>The Fink Project has released fink-0.45.0. This release provides support for macOS 10.14.5 and up, including preliminary support for macOS 10.15beta. This release also provides full support for .app bundles in APFS volumes.</p>
  <p>If your system is still on macOS 10.14.4 or earlier:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>In a terminal window, run <code>fink selfupdate</code> and install <code>fink-0.45.0</code>.</li>
    <li>Update to the latest version of Mojave.</li>

 <headline>Fink for High Sierra (10.13)</headline>
 <body>
  <p>Because of a recent Sourceforge outage, we haven't been able to do a proper <code>fink</code> 
  release that supports High Sierra.  However, since the <code>fink</code> source on 
  Github isn't affected by this, it is possible to get a pre-release version out of our
  <code>git</code> repository and install that.</p>
  <p>The following sequence of steps should allow you to update your Fink installation
  on 10.9 (Mavericks) or later for High Sierra.  10.8 (Mountain Lion) or earlier 
  have no supported upgrade path.</p>
  <p>0) Don't update your OS yet!</p>
  <p>1) Download a copy of the 
  <link url="https://github.com/fink/fink/archive/master.zip">repository archive</link> and
  uncompress it if your browser doesn't do that automatically.</p>
  <p>2) Open a Terminal window and change to the resulting <code>fink-master</code> directory
  e.g. <code>cd ~/Downloads/fink-master</code> .</p>
  <p>3) Run the command <code>sudo ./inject.pl</code> to update <code>fink</code>.</p>
  <p>4) Update your OS to High Sierra.</p>
  <p>5) Open a Terminal window and run <code>fink reinstall fink</code> to reset your distribution.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>For new installs on High Sierra:</p>
  <p>1) Install the Xcode 9 command-line tools by running <code>sudo xcode-select --install</code> 
  in a Terminal window.</p>
  <p>2) Install the latest JDK from Oracle, e.g. by running <code>javac</code> in a Terminal 
  window.</p>
  <p>3) Follow steps 1-2) from the upgrade instructions above.</p>
  <p>4) Run <code>sudo ./bootstrap</code></p>
  <p>5) The default bootstrap operation will error out at the end for the time being, until 
  an official High Sierra binary distribution has been uploaded.  Go ahead and run <code>
  /sw/bin/pathsetup.sh</code> as usual, however.</p>

 <headline>fink-0.38.5 released.</headline>
 <body>
  <p>
  <code>fink-0.38.5</code> was released on 14 May, 2015.  This release enables
  official OS X 10.10.3 support, and reverts a change made in <code>fink-0.38.4</code>
  to restore the requirement that the /usr/X11R6 convenience symlink be present for
  the <code>x11*</code> virtual packages to be active.
  </p>
  <p>
  It also downgrades building libraries with flat namespace from a fatal validation
  error to a warning, since some packages require such a build.  There are a number
  of additional validation enhancements as well.  Check the commit logs on fink's 
  github site for additional information.

 <headline>fink-0.36.4 released</headline>
 <body>
  <p>
  <code>fink-0.36.4</code> was released on 6 April, 2014.
  This <code>fink</code> release restores the use of an official binary distribution by
  default on 10.8 and 10.9 (if distributions are created for 10.6 and 10.7
  those will be supported, too).  In addition, it works around the multiple
  build failures introduced by Xcode 5.1 on 10.8 and 10.9. This release also includes 
  official support for OS X 10.9.2, fixes the bootstrap operation when Xcode.app isn't
  present, and makes x86_64 the default architecture for 10.6 bootstraps.
  </p>
  <p>Users are encouraged to run <code>fink selfupdate</code> to install this version of
  fink, particularly in view of the Xcode 5.1 build issues.</p>

  <headline>Mountain Lion released</headline>
  <body>
   <p>Mountain Lion is now available to the general public.  Ideally, users should update
 to <code>fink-0.34.0</code> or later before updating their OS.  In addition, Xcode 4.4 
 (or at least its command line tools) is required--it can be installed under Lion, but 
 there is a separate version of the Command Line Tools for Mountain Lion, so make sure
 to install those.  Use </p><p><code>fink list xcode</code></p><p>to verify that you have the
 Xcode 4.4 command-line tools installed, and that Fink knows where your Xcode.app is.
 If the CLI tools are missing or not for Xcode 4.4, reinstall them, e.g. via the Xcode 
 Preferences.  If <code>fink</code> isn't finding your Xcode.app, use</p>
 <p><code>sudo xcode-select -switch /path/to/Xcode.app</code></p>
 <p>to make sure that your system's tools are pointing to the right place.  Also run</p>
 <p><code>sudo xcodebuild -license</code></p><p>to make sure that the Xcode license is accepted
 globally on your system, especially for fink's build user.</p>
 <p>Once you have updated the OS, use</p>
 <p><code>fink reinstall fink</code></p><p>to point it to the 10.8 distribution, and run</p>
 <p><code>fink install perl5123-core</code></p><p>to make sure any Perl modules you have
 from Lion will still work.</p>
 <p>If you updated the OS first,
  and have an earlier version of <code>fink</code> which doesn't know about Mountain Lion, you
  have probably found that it doesn't work.  To work around this issue, do the 
  following: (1) download an updated copy of 
  <link url="https://raw.github.com/fink/fink/master/perlmod/Fink/Services.pm">
  Services.pm</link>, (2) move the downloaded file into /sw/lib/perl5/Fink, such as
  via</p><p><code>sudo mv /path/to/Services.pm /sw/lib/perl5/Fink</code></p><p>; 
  (change <filename>/sw</filename> and <filename>/path/to</filename> to match 
  your particular setup); (3) run</p><p><code>fink selfupdate</code></p><p>, which should
  download and install <code>fink-0.34.0</code>; (4) use </p><p><code>fink reinstall fink</code></p>
  <p>to ensure that <code>fink</code> is pointing at the 10.8 distribution, 
  and (5) install <code>perl5123-core</code>
  as above.</p>
  <p><em>Addendum, 2012-07-26:</em>  It appears that the OS update wipes out the
  users that Fink creates (but not the groups).  After following the steps above, you should
  (1) Run</p><p><code>fink configure</code></p><p> to set the Fink build user back up, and 
  (2) use </p><p><code>fink list -it passwd | cut -f2 | xargs fink reinstall</code></p><p> to reinstall
  the various <code>passwd*</code> packages and their users.</p>

  <headline>fink-0.33.0 released</headline>
  <body>
   <p><code>fink-0.33.0</code> was released on 6 June, 2012.  This release introduces some new
    features:</p>
   <p>Starting with this version of <code>fink</code>, packages will be built as an unprivileged
   user by default, which prevents the build process from installing files in the rest of the
   filesystem. (Prior to <code>fink-0.33.0</code> we relied on maintainers to test their packages
   using this method).  Users may find that some packages don't build in this mode, so we appreciate
   feedback, as always, to help us find and correct problems.</p>
   <p>In addition, we have added some additional options for maintainers in this Fink version.
   <em>/sw/Library/Python</em> has been added to the list of valid directories in a package, to
   provide a unified location to install modules built against a built-in Python.  There is
   now an <code>xcode.app</code> virtual package for packages that use <code>xcodebuild</code>
   to BuildDepend upon.  Its version is the version of Xcode.app.  The <code>xcode</code>
   virtual package has always been based on the presence of the command-line tools, and now its
   version is the version of those.  Note that <code>xcode</code> and <code>xcode.app</code>
   are the same for Xcodes prior to 4.3.</p>

    <body>
      <p><code>fink-0.31.2</code> was released to the 10.4/unstable and
      10.7/stable trees on 26 September, 2011.  Packages are now built by default
      using the number of parallel threads specified by the <code>MaxBuildJobs</code>
      field set via <code>fink configure</code>.  In addition, maintainers no longer
      have to specify a particular version of <code>fink</code> to use a
      <code>PatchFile</code>, and fixes a Perl issue.</p>
      <p>It is expected that the package will be added to 10.4/stable shortly.</p>

      10.7/stable trees on
      11 September, 2011.  It fixes an issue in which 32-bit machines running OS
      10.6 wouldn't be allowed to bootstrap, even though this is a fully supported
      configuration.  It also provides a more robust scheme to report on the
      Xcode version in error messages than in prior <code>fink</code> versions.
      Finally OS 10.7.1 is recognized as a supported OS version.</p>
      <p>It is expected that the package will be added to 10.4/stable shortly.</p>

    <headline>Fink and Lion--updated.</headline>
    <body>
      <p>OS X 10.7 "Lion" was released on July 20, 2011.  We want to let Fink
      users know what to expect if updating.</p>
<p>First, the <code>fink</code> 
program itself will not run  on a system which has
been upgraded to Lion, so it is not possible currently to update a Fink
installation in place.  However, is possible to use the
<code>dpkg</code> program to extract a list of the Fink packages
which had been installed under 10.6, so that they can be reinstalled
under 10.7.  Use</p>
<p><code>dpkg --get-selections | cut -f1 > fink_packages.txt</code></p>
<p>before updating to 10.7 to dump the package names to a text file, and</p>
<p><code>cat fink_packages.txt | xargs fink install</code></p>
<p>once you have installed Fink on 10.7.</p>
<p>To upgrade Fink after upgrading to Lion, one will have to bootstrap
Fink again, using a tarball for <code>fink-0.31.0</code> or later.  If you want
to use the same directory (e.g. /sw) for Fink that you were using on 10.6, you'll
need to remove that before bootstrapping, since the bootstrap doesn't allow you
to overwrite an existing Fink tree.</p>
<p>Second, due to lots of changes under the hood, there currently are many fewer
Fink packages which build under 10.7 as opposed to 10.6.
Thus, even if you've extracted a list of Fink packages which had
been installed under 10.6, some of them may not yet be installable under
10.7.  We are currently creating a database showing which packages
can be successfully installed under 10.7, and work is ongoing to add packages.</p>
<p>10.7 introduces several drastic changes to how the system works. While this may
cause a slight delay in full Fink functionality in the short term, it will
make Fink work better in the future.</p>

    <body>
      <p>Apple has announced that OS X 10.7 "Lion" will be released 
in July.  We want to let Fink users know what to expect when Lion is 
released.</p>
<p>First, the <code>fink</code>

<p>once you have installed Fink for 10.7.</p>
<p>(To upgrade fink after upgrading to Lion, one will have to bootstrap
fink again, using a new version of fink which will be released shortly
after Lion has been released.  Watch this space for an announcement.)</p>
<p>Second, due to lots of changes under the hood, there will initially

may not be complete prior to the release of Lion.</p>
<p>10.7 introduces several drastic changes to how the system works. While this may
cause a slight delay in full Fink functionality in the short term, it will
make Fink work better in the future.</p>

    <headline>Happy 10th Birthday to Fink!</headline>
    <body>
      <p>The Fink project was started in the waning days of December 2000 by
Christoph Pfisterer, using the "public beta" release of Mac OS X.
Within a year, versions 10.0 and 10.1 of OS X had been released, and
Fink usage took off.  Our founder chrisp stepped away from the project
in November 2001, and the community took over.</p>
<p>The Fink community is the heart of Fink, involving both package maintainers
and Fink users, as well as the small core team which tries to keep the
overall system in good shape.  The success of this community in keeping
Fink viable and active over ten years is really quite remarkable!  Let's
all join together to keep Fink going for a long time to come.</p>
<p>How long?  In the memorable words of Buzz Lightyear: <code>To Infinity
and Beyond!</code></p>

    <headline>Fink on 10.6.</headline>
    <body>
      <p>
Fink is ready to be used on Snow Leopard (OS X v. 10.6).  Users will
need to choose between a 32-bit version of fink and a 64-bit version of fink
for 10.6.
The 32-bit version has more packages available at the present time, but
the 64-bit version represents the future direction for OS X and for fink;
individual users must make this decision on their own.  It will <em>not</em>
be possible to "upgrade" from 32-bit to 64-bit (or vice versa), without
completely reinstalling fink.
</p><p>
At the moment, two methods are available for installing Fink on Snow Leopard.
A binary installer is not available, so it is important to
<em>first install XCode from the Optional Installs folder on the Snow
Leopard disk.</em>
Users wanting the 64-bit version, or users upgrading directly from 10.4 or
earlier, must bootstrap fink from the distribution tarball (version
0.29.9 or later), available at <link
url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/fink/files/fink/0.29.9/fink-0.29.9.tar.gz/download">sourceforge.net</link>; installation instructions are
<varlink url="download/srcdist.php">here</varlink>.
On the other hand, users can upgrade directly from
10.5 to the 32-bit version, following the instructions below.
(One warning: users who have installed a development version of fink
from CVS rather than a released version may encounter trouble; please
downgrade your fink to a released version, and remove stray .deb files
of higher versions, before beginning.)
</p><p>
To upgrade, follow a four step process.
<em>Step 1:</em> edit the file <code>/sw/etc/fink.conf</code>,
adding a line to it which reads <code>NoAutoIndex: true</code>  (You may
need to use <code>sudo</code> to obtain the correct permissions to edit
this file.)  <em>Step 2:</em> 
run the command <code>fink reinstall fink</code> in
order to tell fink that you are now on 10.6.  (If you encounter a message
about package database corruption, run <code>fink index -f</code> and
try this step again.)  <em>Step 3:</em> 
run the command <code>fink update
fink</code> to get the latest fink for 10.6.  <em>Step 4:</em> run the command
<code>fink install perl588-core</code> to replace the version of perl
which Apple changed during the OS X upgrade, in case you have 
fink packages which depend on it.
</p><p>After the upgrade, you may wish to run <code>fink configure</code>
to do some cleanup.
</p><p>Almost all of the packages in fink's stable tree will compile on
10.6, but be warned that only a fraction of the 10.5 packages are currently
available for 10.6.  In the near future, fink's package database will be
updated to include information about packages for 10.6; you can check there
to see if your favorite package is ready.

    <headline>End of 10.3 support.</headline>
    <body>
      <p>
The Fink project is no longer able to offer support for users of Fink
on Mac OS X 10.3. In reality there has been very little support for
some time, so this announcement simply formalizes that fact.
</p><p>
This means that there will not be any further updates, not even
security updates, for Mac OS X 10.3 users. Their existing
installations will continue to work, but the software that is

    <headline>Mass package migration.</headline>
    <body>
      <p>
The massive GNOME update which has been in process for
many months was merged into fink's unstable tree.  This is well
tested, and updates by users appear to be going fairly smoothly.
</p><p>
We are now merging the gnome update into the stable tree.  Because
we have been unable to test the dependencies of these new packages in
the stable tree in advance, users can expect the "stable" tree to be
"not so stable" during the next few weeks, while the bugs get worked
out.
</p><p>
If you are eager to start using this massive gnome update immediately,
we suggest that you switch to the unstable tree.  If not, we suggest
that you hold off running "fink selfupdate" for a while (perhaps a
week or two) until things have again stabilized.</p>

    <headline>New Fink release.</headline>
    <body>
      <p>
A new (binary) Fink release for OS X 10.5 (Leopard) is 
<varlink url="download/index.php">available</varlink>
 today: version 0.9.0, which can be installed on either Intel or PowerPC
hardware.
The release includes source files, binary packages, and  Fink
installers for both kinds of hardware.
</p>
      <p>
Users who have already installed Fink on Leopard from source, who now wish
to switch to the binary distribution, may do so as follows.  First,
run <code>fink selfupdate</code> to update to the latest version of the
fink package manager.  Next, run <code>fink configure</code>, and be sure
to <em>change</em> your choice about using the binary distribution from No
to yes.  Finally, run <code>fink scanpackages</code> to activate the binary
distribution.
</p>
<p><em>Update, 2008-07-11:</em> If you use the binary installer, you
should run <code>fink selfupdate</code> after installation.</p>

    <headline>Mirror, mirror on the wall, will someone sponsor Fink at all?</headline>
    <body>
        <p>
Every large open source project has to face the problem of distribution and Fink is no different. We want you to get all the files you need to build your favourite application as quickly as possible. A mirror close to your location is a first step to achieving that. 
</p>
        <p>
We are actively working on building a reliable distribution infrastructure consisting of mirrors sponsored by universities and corporations. 
Recently our list of mirrors had to be shortened considerably and we need your <em>help</em> to improve its level of quality again.
</p>
    <p>
Are you a student? Are you a professor? Do you run a Data Center? Are you a developer with free time to spare? Even if you cannot say yes to any of those questions you still might be able to help.
All the relevant information on how to run and sponsor a mirror can be found on the <link url="http://wiki.finkproject.org/index.php/Fink:FinkMirrors">FinkWiki</link>.
For specific questions you can <link url="mailto:fink-core-private@lists.sourceforge.net">contact us</link> directly.
We are looking for mirrors all over the world, but specifically in these countries:</p>
<ul><li>United States</li><li>Japan</li><li>Germany</li><li>France</li><li>United Kingdom</li><li>Canada</li><li>Italy</li><li>Spain</li><li>Switzerland</li><li>Australia</li></ul>
    <p>
We would like to take this opportunity to thank those who are already providing Fink with mirrors. Without your continued support Fink would not be able to provide the level of service it currently does. Thank you!

  <headline>Initial Leopard Support</headline>
  <body>
    <p>The Fink Project announces initial support for Mac OS X Leopard (10.5).</p>
    <p>10.5 users who are starting a new Fink tree will need to do this via bootstrap, until a binary distribution gets generated.  Download fink-0.27.8 <link url="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/fink/fink-0.27.8.tar.gz">here</link>.</p>
    <p>The 10.4->10.5 update can be accomplished by running <code>fink selfupdate</code> to get <code>fink-0.27.8</code> .  If you're doing this on 10.5, make sure that you have Xcode 3.0 installed.  After 10.5 is installed, run <code>fink reinstall fink</code>.</p>
    <p>A direct 10.3->10.5 upgrade path isn't ready yet.  If you're impatient to get going, you'll need to download the <code>fink-0.27.8</code> tarball and bootstrap a new Fink tree as above.</p>
    <p><em>Update, 2007-10-29:</em>  Users who have updated from 10.4 to 10.5 should note that using <code>fink cleanup</code> to remove .deb files will remove <em>all</em> of them.  This issue should be resolved in the next update.</p>
    <p><em>Update, 2007-11-03:</em>  <code>fink-0.27.8</code> or later should solve the above issue as well as a couple of others that have come up.</p>

    <headline>Problems with tar</headline>
    <body>
<p>Some users of fink's unstable tree are having sporadic difficulties
at the end of building large packages, getting reports like
<em>tar: File changed as we read it</em> which causes the .deb file
not to be built.
</p><p>
The fink team is currently studying this problem to determine a permanent
fix.  For the time being, users experiencing this problem can work around
it by issuing the command <code>fink install tar-1.15.1-14</code>.  It
may be necessary to issue that command after each <code>fink update-all</code>
command, as well.
</p><p>Once the fink team has determined how to solve this problem 
permanently, another announcement will be made here.
</p>
<p><em> Update, 16 March 2007: </em> The new version of fink's 
<code>dpkg</code> package resolves this problem.  Unstable users can
now run the update commands normally.

    <headline>Server down; workarounds available</headline>
    <body>
<p><em> Update, 21 August 2006: </em> The server has been restored.</p>
    <p> 
The server which hosts four important
fink services (the rsync update, the binary distribution, the "master mirror" 
of source files, and the package database) is down at the moment.  We are
hoping that the server will be restored as early as Monday, August 21,
but are providing these workarounds for use during the period of outage.
</p><p>
To update fink, you must either select an rsync mirror other than the
primary one (see the next paragraph), or use the command
<code>fink selfupdate-cvs</code>.  You only need to give this command
once; subsequent updates will continue to be performed using CVS.
When the server is restored, you can revert to rsync updating by means
of the command <code>fink selfupdate-rsync</code>.
</p><p>
To work around the lack of the binary distribution, and the "master mirror"
of source files, run the command <code>fink configure</code>.  You should
accept the default answers to all of the questions, except the following:
when asked "Should Fink try to download pre-compiled packages from 
the binary distribution if available?" answer "no" (to disable the binary
distribution); when asked if you want to change the mirror settings,
answer "yes", and then you will be asked "What mirror order should fink use 
when downloading sources?".  The answer is "2: Search Master Mirrors last"
(to disable the automatic attempts to use the master mirror server).
Finally, if you have decided to stick with rsync for updates, when asked to
"Choose a mirror for 'RSync SelfUpdate'" you should choose one other than
rsync://master.us.finkmirrors.net/finkinfo/.  Unfortunately, other choices
might not be available to you if you are in the U.S.
</p><p>
Finally, to use the package database during the outage, you can connect
to <link url="http://pdb.finkproject.org/pdb/">this backup copy of the
package database</link> which is a few weeks out of date.

        <headline>Reminder: "10.4-transitional" Tree Unsupported on August 1st, 2006</headline>
        <body>

            <p>
                The "10.4-transitional" tree was created as an interim solution to the issues of
                incompatibilities between binaries made using GCC 3.3 (the default Mac OS X 10.3
                compiler) and GCC 4.0 (the default Mac OS X 10.4 compiler).  Now that the work to
                move Fink to using GCC 4.0 is essentially finished, we will be stopping official
                support of the "10.4-transitional" tree in favor of the "10.4" tree as of August
                1st, 2006.
            </p>
            <p><em>You should not need to do anything if "fink --version" prints "0.8.1.cvs" or "0.8.1.rsync".</em></p>
            <p>
                As we mentioned <varlink url="news/#2006-07-01%20July%20is%20%22Fink%20Update%20Month%22">previously</varlink>,
                there are 2 ways to make the switch to the supported "10.4" tree.
            </p>
            <p>
                The simplest way is to remove your Fink installation by deleting it and
                installing fresh using the 0.8.1 installer available from the <varlink
                url="download">download page</varlink>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alternately, to preserve your Fink installation, download the
                <link url="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/fink/scripts-10.4-update-0.4.tar.gz?download">upgrade script</link>
                and read the README for instructions on how to upgrade your existing installation in-place.
                This will re-build your Fink installation from source, upgrading everything in the process.
                Be warned, it can take a lot of time, depending on your fink installation!
            </p>
            <p>
                Feedback on the upgrade script has been very positive; many users have already
                made the switch.  If you have problems, please feel free to mail your issues to
                the <varlink url="lists">discussion lists</varlink>.
            </p>
<p><em> Update, 2 June 2007.</em>  Due to changes to the behavior of <filename>sudo</filename> on 10.4.9, the update script needs a bit of assistance.  Switching to a superuser prompt first via <code>sudo -s</code> will suffice.</p>

    <headline>July is "Fink Update Month"</headline>
    <body>
      <p>
Fink users on PowerPC machines are advised to update their copies of
fink from the old "10.4-transitional" tree to the more recent "10.4"
tree.  We plan to discontinue the 10.4-transitional tree
by the end of July, 2006.
</p><p>
Some background: along with OS X 10.4 came a new version of the g++ compiler
(one of the workhorses of Fink), which produced code that was binary
incompatible with previous versions.  Fink, when using the 10.4-transitional 
tree, mixes the new gcc-4.0 compiler with the older g++-3.3 compiler.
This strategy gave us some extra time to make packages compatible with
g++-4.0.  The time has now come to complete that transition, and rely
exclusively on the newer tree.  The update, however, is slightly
complicated since all packages using or providing g++ libraries must
be rebuilt in the correct order.
</p><p>
If you are using OS X 10.4, you can
find out if you need to update your Fink installation
by running the command
<code>fink --version</code>.  If the Distribution version is 0.8.1.cvs
or 0.8.1.rsync, you do <em>not</em> need to update.  However, if the 
Distribution version is 0.8.0.cvs or 0.8.0.rsync, you should update,
as described below.
</p>
<p>
Many users will prefer to remove their fink installations and
start anew with the 0.8.1 installer.  Others will prefer to use the 
<link 
url="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/fink/scripts-10.4-update-0.4.tar.gz?download">10.4-update 
tarball (v. 0.4)</link> (around 12 MB), which includes 
precompiled versions of the basic fink packages as well as a script which
will attempt to update an existing fink installation.  Please consult
the README file which you will find within the 10.4-update directory 
(after unpacking the tarball) for further instructions.
</p>
<p>
Note: Fink users who are upgrading their systems from OS X 10.3 to OS X 10.4
can use the same two options to update their fink installations: they can
either remove their old fink installations and start over, or they can
use the same 10.4-update tarball.  The update script should not be run
until after OS X has been upgraded.

    <headline>New Fink release.</headline>
    <body>
      <p>
A new Fink release for OS X 10.4 (Tiger) is 
<varlink url="download/index.php">available</varlink>
 today: version 0.8.1, which can be installed on either Intel or PowerPC
hardware.
The release includes source files, binary packages, and  Fink
installers for both kinds of hardware.
</p>
      <p>
Fink on the Intel platform is still considered "beta" quality, and a number of
packages (particularly packages in the "unstable" tree) either do not compile,
or compile but do not run.  Work to improve this situation is ongoing.
</p>
<p>
Fink users on PowerPC whose existing fink installation uses the 
10.4-transitional tree (from the 0.8.0 distribution) may upgrade in
one of two ways.  The upgrade process is problematic, due to the change
in ABI of g++ libraries which requires many libraries to be recompiled.
Many users will simply wish to remove their fink installations and
start anew with the 0.8.1 installer.  Others may wish to use the new
<link url="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/fink/scripts-10.4-update-0.3.tar.gz?download">10.4-update tarball (v. 0.3)</link> (around 12 MB), which includes 
precompiled versions of the basic fink packages as well as a script which

    <headline>CVS Troubles</headline>
    <body>
      <p>
As many Fink users are aware, the Fink CVS repository at sourceforge.net
has not been fully functional since March 30.  The anonymous CVS access
has not been updated since then, and as of several days ago, the developers
are also unable to update CVS in any form.
</p><p>
As we understand the current plans of sourceforge's staff (outlined
briefly on their <link 
url="http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=2352&amp;group_id=1">site
status page</link>), the old CVS servers will never be brought back in
their current form.  This is likely to mean disruption for fink users,
but at present, we cannot say what form this disruption will take.
</p><p>
Our current advice to fink users is to switch to the 'rsync' method of
updating (by running the command 'fink selfupdate-rsync').  This will at
least give you a fink installation which is current up through May 7.
If a full update to the new CVS situation turns out to be impossible
via fink's normal selfupdate command, we will post instructions here
on how to update when they become available.
</p>
<p>Update 5/24/06: CVS is now functioning again, and users using the rsync
method of selfupdating are getting up-to-date content.  If you are using
the cvs method, and can't (or don't wish to) switch to rsync, you should
download the file <code>fink-mirrors-0.24.15.2.tar.gz</code> from <link
url="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=17203&amp;package_id=69685">the
Sourceforge file release page</link>, expand the file, and run the command
<code>./inject.pl</code> from within the <code>fink-mirrors-0.24.15.2</code> directory.  After this has been done, the <code>fink selfupdate</code> command
should again work normally.

    <headline>Problem with Apple's Security Update 2006-001</headline>
    <body>
      <p>
The Fink team has received reports of problems with the <code>rsync</code>
program which was modified by Apple's new Security Update 2006-001: for some
users, <code>fink selfupdate</code> fails to function after the Security
Update.  (The underlying cause appears to be a problem with the 
<code>--delete</code> option for <code>rsync</code>.)
</p>
      <p>
As a workaround, users can run <code>fink install rsync</code> to use
fink's rsync package rather than the Apple program.  Or, for those users
who need specific features of the Apple program (such as support for
Extended Attributes), another workaround is <code>fink selfupdate-cvs</code>
to switch from rsync to cvs updating.  
</p>
<p>Update 3/13/06: This has been resolved by security update 2006-002,

    <headline>Preliminary version of Fink on Intel</headline>
    <body>
      <p>
A preliminary version of Fink for the Intel architecture is now ready.
No binary packages are available, and things are still rough around
the edges, but it should be usable if you are patient!
</p>
      <p>
To install it, you need to install the XCode compiler and SDK packages (at minimum).  Then you need to get the file
<code>fink-0.24.16.tar.gz</code> (or a later version, if it's available)
from <link url="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=17203&amp;package_id=13043">the
Sourceforge file release page for Fink</link>, expand the file, and
run the command <code>./bootstrap.sh</code> .  At the end of the
bootstrap process, run <code>fink selfupdate</code> and you'll get
the currently available packages.
</p>
      <p>
At last check, there were about 1750 packages in the "stable" tree, but
about 150 of those did not build.  When things are truly stable, another
annoucement will be made here.

Fink is now ready for XCode 2.2, with the exception of the openoffice.org 
packages (which are expected to function again when we switch to the 10.4
tree).  Users are encouraged to upgrade to XCode 2.2 whenever they wish;
XCode 2.2 will be required for running the 10.4 tree when it is released.
</p>
      <p>
On the other hand, in spite of today's announcements from Apple, Fink is
not ready to run on Intel processors.  The Fink team hopes to have an
Intel-ready version of fink released within a few weeks; the Fink team does 
not advise early recipients of new iMacs to install Fink on them, but suggests
waiting until the new version of fink is ready.

    <headline>New Fink releases.</headline>
    <body>
      <p>
Three new Fink releases are 
<varlink url="download/index.php">available</varlink>
 today: version 0.8.0 (for 10.4),
version 0.7.2 (for 10.3), and version 0.6.4 (for 10.2).
All three releases include source files, binary packages, and a Fink
installer for new users.
</p>
      <p>
The new release for 10.4 includes all currently-available "stable" packages
in source and binary form: there are 1565 of these, which constitutes more
than 80% of the 1909 packages available in the 10.3 release.  Work continues
by the fink developers on bringing more of the stable packages to Tiger.
</p>
      <p>
The new release for 10.2 will be the last official release for that
version of Mac OS X.  Although no further updates (not even security
updates) will be provided by the Fink team, we anticipate that the
0.6.4 release will be usable for years to come.
</p>
      <p>
Users upgrading to 10.4 can now simply issue a 
<code>fink selfupdate</code> command, followed by
<code>sudo /sw/lib/fink/postinstall.pl</code> (for first-time updaters
on 10.4), <code>fink scanpackages</code> and <code>sudo apt-get update</code>.
We don't recommend bootstrapping at the moment, since bootstrapping does
not work with the newly-released XCode 2.1 from Apple.
</p>
      <p>
Note added 6/19/05: If the Fink-0.8.0 binary installer complains that the
volume does not support symlinks, try launching Disk Utility (from the 
Utilities folder inside the Applications folder), selecting the 
problematic volume and clicking on "repair disk permissions."  Also, the installer requires you to have administrative privileges, so be sure that you're running it as such a user.
</p>
      <p>Note added 6/30/05:  To avoid contamination with obsolete headers and the like, we recommend that people who want to build packages from source should perform a clean install of XCode via running the <code>/Developer/Tools/uninstall-devtools.pl</code> script.  For best results, you may want to do this before updating your OS.</p>

    <body>
      <p>
Fink can be used on OS X 10.4!  There are several ways you can update:
</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
A binary installer will be available within a few weeks, for binary-only
users.  In the meantime, new users should bootstrap fink 0.23.10, just
as stable users, below.
</li>
        <li>
For users of the stable tree, we recommend that you delete your current
fink with <code>sudo rm -Rf /sw</code> and then "bootstrap" an
installation of fink-0.23.10 using
<link url="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=17203&amp;package_id=13043&amp;release_id=326600">
fink-0.23.10.tar.gz</link>--download that file and expand it, 
eg. via
<code>tar -xvzf fink-0.23.10.tar.gz</code>.  After running the command
<code> ./bootstrap.sh </code> in the resulting
<filename>fink-0.23.10</filename> directory,
you'll need to run <code>fink selfupdate</code>
</li>
        <li>
For users of the unstable tree, you may be able to upgrade just by running 
<code>fink selfupdate</code> if your version of fink is less than 0.24.6.  
It will install fink-0.24.6 for you.  After upgrading to 10.4, first check 
that you have the right version of fink by issuing <code>fink --version</code>
.  If your version is less than 0.24.6, run <code>fink selfupdate</code> to 
get the right version of fink.  Then, whether you selfupdated or not, 
reinstall the fink package using <code>fink rebuild fink</code>, 
and follow that with another <code>fink selfupdate</code>.
</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Not all packages are working yet under 10.4, but that situation will
improve over the next several weeks.  The stable tree contains substantially
fewer packages than in 10.3, but all of them should compile.
</p>
      <p>Of course, some wrinkles still need to be ironed out.  We encourage 
users with mission-critical applications to check in on the mailing 
lists to verify whether anyone has had experience with the package in 
question before upgrading.</p>

    <headline>Solution to gcc problems.</headline>
    <body>
      <p>
Apple has released the November 2004 gcc3 updater, available (upon free 
registration) at connect.apple.com.  This updater fixes the problems with
the gcc3 compiler in XCode 1.5.  If you are using XCode 1.5, you should 
install this updater.  (The updater will update correctly for users with
an untouched XCode 1.5, and also for users who installed the workaround which
the fink project had previously recommended.)
</p>
      <p>
We would like to thank Apple for responding to our reports about this
matter, and working to resolve it as quickly as possible.

    <headline>Workaround for gcc problems.</headline>
    <body>
      <p>
The version of gcc included with XCode 1.5 is known to produce 
incorrect output from c++ code under certain circumstances.
Fink now has a mechanism to warn users about this, and Fink will soon
refuse
to use the "broken" gcc to compile packages which are known to
have this problem.
</p>
      <p>
If you have already upgraded XCode to version 1.5, there is a workaround,
described <link url="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.os.apple.fink.beginners/13580"> here </link>
and <link url="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.os.apple.fink.beginners/14200"> here </link>.
</p>
      <p> If you have not yet upgraded, you should consider remaining with
XCode version 1.2 until the problem has been resolved.

    <headline>Problems with XCode 1.5</headline>
    <body>
      <p>
    In the past few days, there have been reports that some fink packages 
    do not compile correctly using XCode 1.5.  If you have not already
    upgraded to XCode 1.5, we suggest that you wait until this issue
    is resolved before doing so.
    </p>
      <p>
    If you are having problems with a package which compiled under
    XCode 1.2 but does not compile correctly under XCode 1.5, 
    please report the package to
    the fink-devel mailing list.  (The usual symptom is: some symbols
    are  missing after compiling with g++.)  
    Packages already known to have this problem include
    octave, singular-factory, singular-libfac, and possibly sdl.

    <body>
      <p>
    The fink-0.22.0 package manager, which was available briefly in the 
    unstable tree this past week, had a bug which prevents further
    updating via rsync.  If you installed this version of fink, you
    can recover by running the command 
    <code>fink install fink-0.21.2-1</code> which will downgrade fink
    to the version in the stable tree, and subsequently running
    <code>fink selfupdate</code>
    </p>
      <p>
    If for any reason those commands don't work, go to 
    <link url="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=17203">the 
    fink file release page at sourceforge</link> and download the
    file <code>fink-0.22.1.tar.gz</code> (or a more recent, i.e.,
    higher numbered, version).  Unpack this file with
    <code>tar xfz fink-0.22.1.tar.gz</code> , and then from within the
    fink-0.22.1 directory, run the command <code>./inject.pl</code>
    </p>

    <headline>Improving our mirrors. Can you help?</headline>
    <body>
      <p>
    Fink's decision to gradually build its own network of mirrors
    has paid off. To make sure that we can continue to offer
    a high quality service we need to improve our mirror network.
    It has been some time since we last asked for more mirrors. 
    It is time to do so again. Fink is very grateful for the resources 
    granted to us by our community. To further improve our service to the 
    community we require an even better mirror system. We especially lack 
    mirrors in central Europe, Russia and the Far East. If you feel that 
    you have at least two Mbit to spare for a rsync mirror, or more to offer 
    a distfiles mirror, please <link url="mailto:mirrors@finkmirrors.net">contact us</link>.
    </p>
      <p>
     To get a better understanding of the different types of mirrors 
     Fink offers, please review <link url="http://finkmirrors.net/">finkmirrors.net</link>. This is the official homepage for all mirror related issues.
     If you feel that you can offer other types of resources, 
     web-space for testing as an example, please do not hesitate in <link url="mailto:mirrors@finkmirrors.net">contacting us</link> as well.

      <p>
    Last year has been a good year for Fink. We have had hard times keeping up with 
    the changes introduces by Apple, but we also learned that we have a great community
    which is willing to go through great lengths to support us. 
    For this, we say "Thank You". Much of what happens in the Fink project
   happens because of the amazing support and encouragement we get from our users.
    </p>
      <p>
    Two Zero Zero Four should not make us slow down, but speed up. There are some 
    interesting things in the pipeline, including GNOME 2.4, a new release of KDE, major 
    changes to the package manager itself, and organisational restructuring. 
    Hopefully we will advance into an even bigger project with developer conferences, 
    real life meetings, and a CD in your favourite shop.
    </p>
      <p>
    High ambitions can make one fall very deeply, thus we shall take it carefully, but 
    still we are all counting on your support during this year. Tell us what you think 
    about Fink; tell us what you like or dislike; show us ways to improve ourselves.
    Lend us your resources and sponsor a mirror or hardware. Devote some of your time
    to improve the package manager or add another piece of software by creating an

    <headline>Fink 0.6.2 released</headline>
    <body>
      <p>The latest Fink release, version 0.6.2, is now available
for both source and binary users.  This is a bug-fix release, intended
to address two problems: the dselect/user deletion bug, and a 
problem with ownership of files.  The dselect bug was addressed by
updating the fink, dpkg, and apt packages.  After updating to 0.6.2,
it is safe to once again use dselect.  However, if you ran dselect
at any time since 0.6.0, you should carefully check the integrity
of the file at <code>/sw/etc/apt/sources.list</code>.  If you have
any doubts about this file, you should replace it with
<varlink url="files/sources.list">the default sources.list file</varlink>.
</p>
      <p>Users who have installed binary files from the 0.6.1 distribution
may find that certain files in their Fink installation are owned
by UID 2011 rather than by root.  To correct this problem,
run the command:</p>
      <codeblock>sudo find /sw/ -user 2011 -exec chown root:admin {} \;</codeblock>
      <p>This release, like the previous one, was built on OS X 10.2
using the gcc 3.3 compiler, and runs fine with some exceptions* on OS X 10.3.  Most Fink 
users who upgrade to 10.3 will continue to
want to only use the binaries from this
new distribution for now, while the Fink team continues to modify
Fink packages for 10.3.
</p>
      <p>*Exceptions include: emacs, qt.

    <headline>User Deletion Bug/ Dselect Troubles</headline>
    <body>
      <p><em>Quick Summary: DO NOT USE DSELECT,</em> and if you've used it,
check your /sw/etc/apt/sources.list file carefully.</p>
      <p>Users who have bootstrapped or installed Fink 0.5.3 or Fink 0.6.0
        on Mac OS X 10.3 could exhibit a problem where all users get deleted
        from the netinfo database, and you become unable to log in.
We believe that this problem can only occur if you've used dselect.</p>
      <p>If you are using Mac OS X 10.3, please be sure you're using the
        latest Fink version to avoid the issue.  To make sure you don't have
        upgrade problems, check your <code>/sw/etc/apt/sources.list</code>
        file.  You will need to modify it if it contains <code>deb</code>
        lines that point to "release" or "current" without a version number.
        In other words, if your <code>sources.list</code> file contains
        these lines:</p>
      <codeblock>deb http://us.dl.sourceforge.net/fink/direct_download release main
deb http://us.dl.sourceforge.net/fink/direct_download current main</codeblock>
      <p>...you should change them to this:</p>
      <codeblock>deb http://us.dl.sourceforge.net/fink/direct_download 10.3/release main
deb http://us.dl.sourceforge.net/fink/direct_download 10.3/current main</codeblock>
      <p>We are working on updating the repository to make sure that even
        if you update you don't get the broken code, and to
repair dselect, but in the meantime,

      <p>Other users have experienced problems with dselect itself, particularly
complaints about a missing "darwin" package.  If you are running dselect

    <headline>Fink 0.6.1 released</headline>
    <body>
      <p>The latest Fink release, version 0.6.1, is now available
for both source and binary users.  This release was built on OS X 10.2
using the gcc 3.3 compiler, and runs well on OS X 10.3.  Most Fink
users who upgrade to 10.3 will want to only use the binaries from this
new distribution for now, while the Fink team continues to modify
Fink packages for 10.3.
</p>
      <p>
If you wish to access the 
new binaries, use apt-get, dselect, or the binary mode of
FinkCommander.  Unless you are interested in helping the Fink team
to test packages which are compiled on 10.3, 
do not use the command-line <code>fink</code> program to do your
installations for the
next few weeks.
</p>
      <p>The simplest way to upgrade a binary installation is to run
"sudo apt-get update".  Further details and
other issues related to upgrading Fink to 10.3 are addressed on the
<varlink url="download/10.3-upgrade.php">Special 10.3 upgrade page.</varlink>
</p>
      <p>
Before using the latest version of
the command-line <code>fink</code> program 
under OS X 10.2, be sure to install the August2003gccUpdater, available
after free registration from connect.apple.com.

      <p>
        We wish all of you a happy Halloween.
        </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore I would like to welcome our new mirrors to the Fink family.
        From Europe in Rijeka, Croatia a new full mirror joins us. This mirrors 
        has been sponsored by the <link url="http://mac.dir.hr/">Jabucnjak</link> Apple user group. 
        This is our first mirror in Europe, so I hope that more will be joining us 
        soon.
        </p>
      <p>
        Dave Schroeder from the <link url="http://mirror.services.wisc.edu/">University of 
        Wisconsin</link> in Madison is sponsoring a 100Mbit dedicated Master server.
        A. J. Wright and <link url="http://sunsite.utk.edu/">SunSITE@UTK</link> are helping out with 
        another full mirror in the United states. 
        </p>
      <p>
        This raises our full mirror count to four and the rsync mirror count to 
        five. We are happy to have such a great community back us up, but I know 
        that more mirrors will join over time. I will not stop nagging you until
        Fink has its own mirror in every state of the USA. Yet, with such a 
        brilliant community backing us up, I am not too worried about not
        reaching my goal very soon.
        </p>
      <p>
        Trick or treat! Our most wanted treat is more mirrors, so come forth 
        Administrators and fill our bag. Information on how you can be a mirror
        can be found on the official <link url="http://finkmirrors.net">

    <body>
      <p>As you surely noticed, Fink has a logo. This is the result of our
    Logo <varlink url="logo.php">contest</varlink> held earlier this year.
    This new, official, logo has been displayed since the 24th of October and
    those of you who wondered how it has been picked and what the name of the
    winner is should read up in the PR <varlink url="pr/index.php">section</varlink>.
    </p>
      <p>
    The longer explanation also features a larger version of the logo itself,
    so that you may have a closer look at its details. We like our new logo,
    we hope that you will like it too.
    </p>
      <p>IMPORTANT: We do not yet have a formal licensing agreement for the new
   logo and so are unable to give permission to distribute it.  Currently, it
   can only be displayed on the Fink web page.  Thank you for your understanding.

    <headline>Upgrade to gcc 3.3 and/or 10.3</headline>
    <body>
      <p>It is now possible to upgrade Fink to take full advantage of the gcc 3.3
compiler, or to use OS X 10.3 if you have that installed.  Binary packages
corresponding to these upgrades are not yet available, so if you make 
extensive use of binary packages you may wish to wait a few days before 
upgrading.
</p>
      <p>
If you wish to perform this upgrade, and you had previously installed the
June 2003 Developer Tools update from Apple, you will need to install
the August 2003 Developer Tools update BEFORE you upgrade Fink.  Under
10.3, be sure to install XCode from the XCode disk before upgrading
Fink.
</p>
      <p>
Running "fink selfupdate" should perform the upgrade for you.  The latest
version of the fink package manager will automatically detect which
version of OS X and which version of gcc you have installed, and will
adjust itself accordingly.
</p>
      <p>
If you wish to do a fresh install of Fink on a 10.3 system, we recommend
<varlink url="download/srcdist.php">bootstrapping from
source,</varlink> starting from fink-full-0.6.0.tar.gz available
on fink's <link url="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=17203">sourceforge 
download page.</link>  You'll need XCode for this as
well.
</p>
      <p>
Also note that once you have Fink version 0.15.0 or higher, you do
not need to install system-xfree86 anymore.  Fink is
capable of automatically determining your system-xfree86 version if you
don't already have any fink x11 packages installed.  If you currently
have an old system-xfree86 package of any kind installed, please run the
following:
</p>
      <codeblock>sudo dpkg -r --force-all system-xfree86 system-xfree86-42 \
system-xfree86-43; fink selfupdate; fink index</codeblock>
      <p>
The Fink team is still working on getting Fink packages working under 10.3,
but many many packages already work.

    <body>
      <p>As announced in <link url="http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2003-21.html">this CERT 
advisory</link>, it has recently been discovered that
the ftp servers for GNU software were compromised back in March, 
although it is not believed that any of the source code housed there
was affected.
</p>
      <p>
Fink relies on MD5 checksums when downloading software, and we have had
no reports of incorrect checksums in Fink packages.  The Free Software
Foundation is in the process of verifying the integrity of all of the
source code distributed from that ftp site.  As of this writing, the source
code for the following Fink packages have not yet been verified:
<code>autoconf2.54</code>,
<code>emacs21</code>,
<code>gprolog</code>,
<code>groff</code>,
<code>guile16</code>,
<code>help2man</code>,
<code>jwhois</code>,
<code>libtool14</code>,
<code>libosip1</code>,
<code>sed</code>,
<code>slib</code>.
It may be difficult to install those packages at present.

    <headline>Developer Tools Update.</headline>
    <body>
      <p><em>Quick Summary: DO NOT INSTALL THIS UPDATE.</em></p>
      <p>
Apple has released a patch to the December 2002 
Developer Tools which includes gcc 3.3,
their new compiler.
</p>
      <p>
Fink does not yet support compiling with gcc 3.3.  In addition, it is important
not to "mix and match" between compilers:  all C++ code in fink packages
needs to be compiled
with the same compiler.
</p>
      <p>
For this reason, the Fink team recommends that if you update your
Developer Tools with the new patch, you should be careful to run
<code>sudo gcc_select 3</code>
prior to any "fink build" or "fink install" commands.
</p>
      <p><em>Update 30 June 2003:</em> A 
<link url="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=2680195&amp;forum_id=2056">problem
has now been detected</link> with
the new assembler program which the update installs, which may prevent
certain Fink packages from being compiled at all if you install this
update.  
</p>
      <p><em>Generally, Fortran programs will break if you install the update;
the breakage does not stop by simply switching back to gcc 3.1.</em>
The Fink team is working on a workaround for this problem, but until it
is ready, if you need Fortran-related programs you should not install
the update.</p>

    <headline>Apple X11 Library Warning</headline>
    <body>
      <p>
    While Apple's X11 works just fine with existing binaries, it
has a bug in the install name of the libraries that can cause some
software to build incorrectly, and will break forward-compatibility
with future X11 releases.
</p>
      <p>
    Ben Hines has created a script (available <link url="http://fink.cvs.sourceforge.net/*checkout*/fink/fix-fink/install_name_fix.pl">here</link>) that you can use
that will fix the install_name entries in Apple's X11 libraries,
but it will not repair software you have already built against the
broken libraries.

    <body>
      <p>
        A problem was uncovered today concerning the versions of imlib,
 libpng, and gnome in Fink's unstable tree.  The Fink team is hard at
 work addressing this problem.  As a workaround, users can downgrade
their imlib package to the stable version, "<code>fink install
 imlib-1.9.10-9</code>", until the problem is fixed.
</p>
      <p>
   Many Fink users may be using Fink's unstable tree without being
fully aware of what this entails.  For a few months in the fall,
enabling the unstable tree was the only way to gain access to
 10.2-compatible versions of Fink packages.  
<em>That is no longer the case.</em>
Fink users who do not wish to help the Fink team with testing should
disable their unstable tree.  To do this, edit the file
<code>/sw/etc/fink.conf</code> and remove the items
 <code>unstable/main</code> and <code>unstable/crypto</code> from the
 <code>Trees</code> line.
    </p>
      <p>The Fink team appreciates those users who are willing to stick with
the unstable tree, even when there are problems like today's, and provide
the team with prompt feedback.  This is a community effort and we
appreciate your participation.

      <p>A new <varlink url="download/upgrade.php">Upgrade Matrix</varlink> is
  now available, for use in upgrading earlier versions of Fink to the
  current version, under either OS X 10.1 or OS X 10.2.  Users upgrading
  under 10.1 will be brought to Fink version 0.4.1a, while users
  upgrading under 10.2 will be brought to Fink version 0.5.0a.

      <p>The Fink team is aware of the shortcomings of the current

to Fink 0.5.0a.  Please be patient as we construct
  a new version of that page, whose existence will be announced

    <headline>Fink 0.5.0a Released</headline>
    <body>
      <p>
    Fink 0.5.0a for Mac OS X 10.2 is now complete. (Note: 0.5.0a is a final
    release, and replaces 0.5.0 which was never officially released.) This
    release includes over 700 
    binary packages for OS X 10.2 as well as over 1800 source packages of
    all kinds. 
  </p>
      <p>
      The source release and the binary installer are available now, as well as all binary packages. For information about upgrading, visit the <varlink url="download/upgrade.php">Upgrade Matrix</varlink>. 
  </p>
      <p>
  This release is for Mac OS X 10.2 only. 10.1 users should use Fink 0.4.1.

    <headline>Update XFree86 for use with OS X 10.2.2</headline>
    <body>
      <p>
Users should update their XFree86 installations to version 4.2.1.1
for use with OS X 10.2.2.  If you are using system-xfree86, you
can get the new version from the <link url="https://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=118483">XonX 
project</link>.  If you are using Fink's
xfree86 packages, you should update to xfree86-base-4.2.1.1-1 and
xfree86-rootless-4.2.1.1-1.  These packages are recent additions to
the 10.2/unstable tree; to gain access to them, you may need to run 
"fink selfupdate-cvs" and/or enable the unstable tree

    <headline>Don't reuse binary installer</headline>
    <body>
      <p>
  Users are cautioned to use the binary installer for Fink 0.4.1 <em>only
once</em> on a given machine.  Due to an apparent bug in Apple's
Installer.app program, attempting a second installation on the same
machine can result in permissions being altered in the machine's root
directory, in some cases leaving the machine in a non-bootable state.
</p>
      <p> If Installer.app presents you with an "Upgrade" button rather
than an "Install" button when installing Fink 0.4.1, <em>do not proceed
any further!</em> </p>
      <p>A new version of the binary installer for Fink 0.4.1 became available
on November 5.  The new version avoids
the problem of the machine not booting, but even with the new version,
users are advised to only "Install",
not "Upgrade."  (You can recognize the new version by its filesize of
12582912 bytes, while the old version had a filesize of 10541112 bytes.)

      <p>
    This is the <em>last release for Mac OS X 10.1</em>. Future versions of Fink will <em>not</em> officially support Mac OS X 10.1 anymore, we are gearing all our efforts towards 10.2.
    </p>
      <p>
    At the same time, this release is not meant for Mac OS X 10.2. Fink 0.5.0. which is targeted for October, will be geared towards 10.2. In the meantime refer to the news item below on how to upgrade Fink for 10.2.

    <headline>Test version of Jaguar updater available</headline>
    <body>
      <p>
            A test version of the 10.2 updater for Fink is now available. The update process is somewhat complicated at the moment, but is explained in <varlink url="news/jaguar.php">step-by-step instructions for updating</varlink>. We also have separate <varlink url="news/jag-bootstrap.php">instructions to install Fink from scratch on 10.2</varlink>. 
        </p>
      <p>
            At the moment, approximately 800 out of 1150 Fink packages have been made ready for 10.2. However, virtually all of these packages are still being tested and have not yet been moved to the "stable" tree in the 10.2 section; moreover, binaries for 10.2 packages are not yet available.

    <headline>Mac OS X 10.2 / Jaguar</headline>
    <body>
      <p>
      During the last few weeks, we got a lot of emails asking whether Fink will work Mac OS X 10.2.
    </p>
      <p>
      The answer is: Yes, we will support 10.2. However, due to some
      major changes in this new OS version, we had to make a lot of adjustments both
      to the Fink tool itself and to many packages. The current binary distribution,
      0.4.0a, will only work partially on 10.2. We are working on an upgrade guide,
      as well as a new Fink release, to support 10.2.
    </p>
      <p>
     If you upgrade your system to 10.2 before the official Fink update for 10.2 is ready,
     many Fink packages built on 10.1 are going to work fine, but others need to be rebuilt.
     Some packages need special changes to build on 10.2. Adding "unstable/main" to your
     list of trees in /sw/etc/fink.conf (see also the <varlink url="faq/usage-fink.php#unstable">FAQ</varlink>)
     will give you access to the latest versions of packages, many of which include important
     fixes for 10.2.
    </p>
      <p>
     As of now, please do not email us asking about 10.2 support. If you can't wait,
     consult the <varlink url="lists/index.php">mailing list archives</varlink> instead.

      <p>
      Yesterday version 0.10.0 of the Fink package manager was released to the unstable tree, along with version 1.6 of the base-files package. All Fink users which are using the unstable tree are recommended to update to this version. The easiest way to do so usually is to run 'fink selfupdate-cvs' which will automatically take care of updating these essential packages.
    </p>
      <p>
      Please report any problems you encounter with this version via our bug tracker.

    <headline>Bug in passwd package</headline>
    <body>
      <p>
      All Fink users are urged to update their <em> passwd </em> package to version 20020329 or newer. Older versions of the <em> passwd </em> package are affected by a bug which could lead to the loss of all data on your hard disk if you remove system users created by Fink manually from the system via System Preferences. (Removing them via the NetInfo tool is safe.) You can check the version of your passwd package by entering <em> dpkg -s passwd</em>. If your version is outdated, you can update to the current one in two ways: 
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
        Via the binary distribution. First make sure you have the latest list of packages available: <em> sudo apt-get update</em>. Then you can perform the actual update: <em> sudo apt-get install passwd</em>. 
      </li>
        <li>
        Via the source distribution. First make sure you have the latest set of package descriptions: <em> fink selfupdate-cvs</em>. Then, update the passwd package: <em> fink update passwd</em> 
      </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      See <varlink url="faq/usage-general.php#passwd">Fink's FAQ, question 6.3,</varlink> for more information about the passwd package.
