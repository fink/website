Fink users on PowerPC machines are advised to update their copies of
fink from the old "10.4-transitional" tree to the more recent "10.4"
tree.  We plan to discontinue the 10.4-transitional tree
by the end of July, 2006.
</p><p>
Some background: along with OS X 10.4 came a new version of the g++ compiler
(one of the workhorses of Fink), which produced code that was binary
incompatible with previous versions.  Fink, when using the 10.4-transitional 
tree, mixes the new gcc-4.0 compiler with the older g++-3.3 compiler.
This strategy gave us some extra time to make packages compatible with
g++-4.0.  The time has now come to complete that transition, and rely
exclusively on the newer tree.  The update, however, is slightly
complicated since all packages using or providing g++ libraries must
be rebuilt in the correct order.
</p><p>
If you are using OS X 10.4, you can
find out if you need to update your Fink installation
by running the command
fink --version.  If the Distribution version is 0.8.1.cvs
or 0.8.1.rsync, you do not need to update.  However, if the 
Distribution version is 0.8.0.cvs or 0.8.0.rsync, you should update,
as described below.
</p>
<p>
Many users will prefer to remove their fink installations and
start anew with the 0.8.1 installer.  Others will prefer to use the 
<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/fink/scripts-10.4-update-0.4.tar.gz?download">10.4-update 
tarball (v. 0.4)</a> (around 12 MB), which includes 
precompiled versions of the basic fink packages as well as a script which
will attempt to update an existing fink installation.  Please consult
the README file which you will find within the 10.4-update directory 
(after unpacking the tarball) for further instructions.
</p>
<p>
Note: Fink users who are upgrading their systems from OS X 10.3 to OS X 10.4
can use the same two options to update their fink installations: they can
either remove their old fink installations and start over, or they can
use the same 10.4-update tarball.  The update script should not be run
until after OS X has been upgraded.

A new Fink release for OS X 10.4 (Tiger) is 
<a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/download/index.php">available</a>
 today: version 0.8.1, which can be installed on either Intel or PowerPC
hardware.
The release includes source files, binary packages, and  Fink
installers for both kinds of hardware.
</p>
      <p>
Fink on the Intel platform is still considered "beta" quality, and a number of
packages (particularly packages in the "unstable" tree) either do not compile,
or compile but do not run.  Work to improve this situation is ongoing.
</p>
<p>
Fink users on PowerPC whose existing fink installation uses the 
10.4-transitional tree (from the 0.8.0 distribution) may upgrade in
one of two ways.  The upgrade process is problematic, due to the change
in ABI of g++ libraries which requires many libraries to be recompiled.
Many users will simply wish to remove their fink installations and
start anew with the 0.8.1 installer.  Others may wish to use the new
<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/fink/scripts-10.4-update-0.3.tar.gz?download">10.4-update tarball (v. 0.3)</a> (around 12 MB), which includes 
precompiled versions of the basic fink packages as well as a script which

      <p>
As many Fink users are aware, the Fink CVS repository at sourceforge.net
has not been fully functional since March 30.  The anonymous CVS access
has not been updated since then, and as of several days ago, the developers
are also unable to update CVS in any form.
</p><p>
As we understand the current plans of sourceforge's staff (outlined
briefly on their <a href="http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=2352&amp;group_id=1">site
status page</a>), the old CVS servers will never be brought back in
their current form.  This is likely to mean disruption for fink users,
but at present, we cannot say what form this disruption will take.
</p><p>
Our current advice to fink users is to switch to the 'rsync' method of
updating (by running the command 'fink selfupdate-rsync').  This will at
least give you a fink installation which is current up through May 7.
If a full update to the new CVS situation turns out to be impossible
via fink's normal selfupdate command, we will post instructions here
on how to update when they become available.
</p>
<p>Update 5/24/06: CVS is now functioning again, and users using the rsync
method of selfupdating are getting up-to-date content.  If you are using
the cvs method, and can't (or don't wish to) switch to rsync, you should
download the file fink-mirrors-0.24.15.2.tar.gz from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=17203&amp;package_id=69685">the
Sourceforge file release page</a>, expand the file, and run the command
./inject.pl from within the fink-mirrors-0.24.15.2 directory.  After this has been done, the fink selfupdate command
should again work normally.

The Fink team has received reports of problems with the rsync
program which was modified by Apple's new Security Update 2006-001: for some
users, fink selfupdate fails to function after the Security
Update.  (The underlying cause appears to be a problem with the 
--delete option for rsync.)
</p>
      <p>
As a workaround, users can run fink install rsync to use
fink's rsync package rather than the Apple program.  Or, for those users
who need specific features of the Apple program (such as support for
Extended Attributes), another workaround is fink selfupdate-cvs
to switch from rsync to cvs updating.  
</p>
      <p>
This news item will be updated as the situation changes.
</p>
<p>Update 3/13/06: This has been resolved by security update 2006-002,
<a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=303453">according
to Apple's documentation</a>.

A preliminary version of Fink for the Intel architecture is now ready.
No binary packages are available, and things are still rough around
the edges, but it should be usable if you are patient!
</p>
<p>
To install, you need to get the file fink-0.24.12.tar.gz
from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=17203&amp;package_id=13043">the
Sourceforge file release page for Fink</a>, expand the file, and
run the command ./bootstrap.sh .  At the end of the
bootstrap process, run fink selfupdate and you'll get
the currently available packages.
</p>
<p>
At last check, there were about 1750 packages in the "stable" tree, but
about 150 of those did not build.  When things are truly stable, another
annoucement will be made here.

Fink is now ready for XCode 2.2, with the exception of the openoffice.org 
packages (which are expected to function again when we switch to the 10.4
tree).  Users are encouraged to upgrade to XCode 2.2 whenever they wish;
XCode 2.2 will be required for running the 10.4 tree when it is released.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, in spite of today's announcements from Apple, Fink is
not ready to run on Intel processors.  The Fink team hopes to have an
Intel-ready version of fink released within a few weeks; the Fink team does 
not advise early recipients of new iMacs to install Fink on them, but suggests
waiting until the new version of fink is ready.
</p>
<p>Fink package maintainers please take note of the new Architecture field, now documented in the packaging manual.

Three new Fink releases are 
<a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/download/index.php">available</a>
 today: version 0.8.0 (for 10.4),
version 0.7.2 (for 10.3), and version 0.6.4 (for 10.2).
All three releases include source files, binary packages, and a Fink
installer for new users.
</p>
<p>
The new release for 10.4 includes all currently-available "stable" packages
in source and binary form: there are 1565 of these, which constitutes more
than 80% of the 1909 packages available in the 10.3 release.  Work continues
by the fink developers on bringing more of the stable packages to Tiger.
</p>
<p>
The new release for 10.2 will be the last official release for that
version of Mac OS X.  Although no further updates (not even security
updates) will be provided by the Fink team, we anticipate that the
0.6.4 release will be usable for years to come.
</p>
<p>
Users upgrading to 10.4 can now simply issue a 
fink selfupdate command, followed by
sudo /sw/lib/fink/postinstall.pl (for first-time updaters
on 10.4), fink scanpackages and sudo apt-get update.
We don't recommend bootstrapping at the moment, since bootstrapping does
not work with the newly-released XCode 2.1 from Apple.

En pocas semanas estará disponible un instalador binario, para aquellos que sólo utilizan binarios.

¡Fink puede usarse para OS X 10.4!  Hay diferentes formas de actualizarse:
</p>

En pocas semanas estará disponible un instalador binario, para aquellos que sólo utilizan binarios.

Para usuarios de la rama estable, recomendamos borrar la instalación actual de
fink con sudo rm -Rf /sw y "bootstrap" una instalación de 
fink-0.23.9 utilizando

Apple ha liberado el actualizador de gcc versión Noviembre 2004, disponible
(tras registro gratutito) en connect.apple.com.  Este actualizador elimina
el problema del compilador gcc3 en XCode 1.5.  Si estás usando  XCode 1.5, 
debes instalarlo.  (El instalador funcionará correctamente tanto
para aquellos usuarios que no han utilizado el parche recomendado por
el proyecto Fink como para aquellos que lo usaron en su momento.)
</p><p>
Agradecemos a Apple su respuesta a nuestros informes sobre este asunto
y el trabajo realizado para resolverlo rápidamente.

Se sabe que la versión de gcc incluída en XCode 1.5 produce 
salidas incorrectas desde código c++ bajo determinadas circunstancias.
Fink tiene ahora un mecanismo para avisar al usuario de esto. Además, 
Fink pronto rechazará el uso de esta versión "rota" para compilar paquetes
de los cuales se sepa que tienen este problema.</p>
      <p>
Si te has pasado ya a la versión 1.5 de XCode una solución se halla descrita 
<a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.os.apple.fink.beginners/13580"> aquí </a> y 
también <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.os.apple.fink.beginners/14200"> aquí </a>.
</p>
      <p> Si no te has actualizado aún, nuestro consejo es que 
consideres no hacerlo y quedarte con  XCode versión 1.2 
hasta que el problema sea resuelto.

La versión más reciente de Fink, versión 0.7.1 (para 10.3), ya está disponible como código fuente y como binario. 
Ésta ha sido creada para la versión Panther (10.3) de Mac OS X. La versión 0.6.3 sigue estando disponible para la versión Jaguar (10.2) de Mac OS X.
</p>

<p>
Esta nueva versión incorpora varias correcciones al manejador de paquetes e integra numerosos binarios previamiente inaccesibles 
dando como resultado un gran total de 1650 binarios. Ésto incluye binarios para KDE 3.1.4 y GNOME 2.4.
</p>

<p>
Para realizar una primera instalación de Fink, hay que seguir los consejos 
de <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/download/index.php">esta página</a>. Es posible actualizar una instalación de Fink previa, utilizando la instalación previa de Fink. En <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/pdb/compare.php?tree1=0.7.1-stable&amp;cmp=0&amp;tree2=0.7.0-stable&amp;splitoffs=on&amp;sort=name">esta página</a> encontraras la lista de las diferencias entre las versiones 0.7.0 y 0.7.1.
</p>

<p>
Si tienes alguna pregunta o problema, usa las listas de correo de Fink. Más información acerca de estas 
listas la encontraras <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/lists/index.php">aquí</a>.

</p>

<p>
Asegúrate de seleccionar el instalador adecuado para tu plataforma. Fink 0.6.3 solo se funcionará en Mac OS X 10.2.* mientras que Fink 0.7.1 sólo se funcionará en Mac OS X 10.3.* </p>

<p>
El Equipo de Fink desea agradecer a sus muchos contributores, ayudantes frecuentes y a los desarrolladores por hacer que esta liberación ocurriera. 
También agradecemos a nuestra comunidad por descarger la versión 0.7.0 más de 130.000 veces. 
Sin su constante apoyo y valiosas indicaciones Fink no estaría donde está ahora...

	Recientemente han habido reportes de varios paquetes del Fink que no

	Si has tenido problemas con algún paquete que compilaba correctamente

	La desición de Fink de incrementar gradualmente nuestra red de espejos
	a pagado con creces. Para asegurarnos de seguir ofreciendo un

	Ya ha pasado bastante tiempo desde la última vez que solicitamos más
	espejos. Así que, es momento de hacerlo de nuevo.  Fink esta muy
	agradecido por los recursos concedidos por nuestra comunidad. Para
	mejorar nuestro servicio a la comunidad requerimos un aún mejor
	sistema de espejos. En particular, carecemos de espejos en Europa
	Central, Rusia y el Lejano Oriente. Sí sientes que tienes 2 Mbit para
	compartir con un espejo de rsync, o aún más para ofrecer un espejo de
	distfiles, por favor  <a href="mailto:mirrors@finkmirrors.net">contactanos</a>.
