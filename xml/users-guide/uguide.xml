      <title>What is Fink?</title>
      <p>
Fink is a distribution of Unix Open Source software for Mac OS X and
Darwin.
It brings a wide range of free command-line and graphical software
developed for Linux and similar operating systems to your Mac.
</p>

      <title>Requirements</title>
      <p>
In any case you will need:
</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
An installed Mac OS X system, version 10.2 or later, or equivalent
Darwin releases.
Earlier versions of both will <em>not</em> work.
See below for more information about supported systems.
</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
Internet access.
Both source code and binary packages are downloaded from Internet
download sites.
</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
If you intend to use the source distribution (see below), you will
also need:
</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
Development tools.
On Mac OS X, install the Developer.pkg package from the Developer
Tools CD.
Note that the tools must match your Mac OS X version.
On Darwin, the tools should be present in the default install.
</p>
          <p>
It's a good idea to have the Developer Tools installed even if you
don't intend to build packages from source.
Some of the programs installed by the package are actually general
purpose command line tools.
Some packages may depend on those to run.
</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
Patience.
Compiling several big packages takes time.
I'm talking hours or even days here.
</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section name="supported-os" >
      <title>Supported Systems</title>
      <p>
        <em>Mac OS X 10.3</em> is the operating system of choice for running
Fink.
All developers run it, and packages are tested on this system.
It is considered &quot;fully supported and tested&quot;, although there may
still be stray compile problems with single packages.
</p>
<p><em>Mac OS X 10.2</em> is still supported, though some newer packages may not have 10.2 versions available.</p>
      <p>
        <em>Mac OS X 10.1</em> is still supported to some extent.
You must run Fink 0.4.1 and no later versions.
</p>
      <p>
Darwin 7.0.1 is the Darwin version corresponding to Mac OS X 10.3, and <em>Darwin 6.0.2</em> is the Darwin version corresponding to Mac OS X
10.2.
They should work in general, but are not as well tested as most people
just run Mac OS X proper instead.
You may run into problems with packages that use features specific to
Mac OS X - affected packages include XFree86 and possibly esound.
</p>
    </section>
    <section name="src-vs-bin" >
      <title>Source vs. Binary</title>
      <p>
Software is written (&quot;developed&quot;) in human-readable programming
languages; this form is called the &quot;source code&quot;.
Before a computer can actually run a program, it must be transformed
into low-level machine code instructions (unreadable by most humans).
That process is called &quot;compiling&quot; and the resulting program is called
&quot;executable&quot; or &quot;binary&quot;.
(The process is also refered to as &quot;building&quot;, because it usually
involves more steps than just compiling.)
</p>
      <p>
When you buy commercial software you don't get to see the source code,
though - companies treat it as a trade secret.
You only get the ready-to-run executable, which means you have no way
to modify the program or even find out what it actually does when it's
run.
</p>
      <p>
Not so with <link url="http://www.opensource.org/" >Open Source</link>
software.
As the name implies, the source code is open for anyone to see and
modify.
In fact, most Open Source software is only distributed as source code
by its authors, and you must compile it on your computer to get a
program that can be run.
</p>
      <p>
Fink lets you choose between the two models.
The &quot;source&quot; distribution will download the original source, adapt it
to Mac OS X and to Fink's policy, and compile it on your computer.
That process is fully automated, but takes some time.
The &quot;binary&quot; distribution on the other hand will download pre-compiled
packages from the Fink site and install those, saving you the time for
compiling.
It is actually possible to mix the two models at will.
The rest of this manual will show you how.

  <chapter filename="install" >
    <title>First Time Installation</title>
    <shorttitle>Install</shorttitle>
    <preface>
      <p>
During first time installation, a base system with the package
management tools is installed on your machine.
After that you must set up your shell environment to use the software
installed by Fink.
You only need to do this once; you can upgrade any Fink installation
(starting with release 0.2.0) in place, without reinstalling.
This is covered in the <xref chapter="upgrade" >Upgrading
chapter</xref>.
</p>
      <p>
Once you have the package management tools installed, you can use them
to install more software.
This is covered in the <xref chapter="packages" >Installing Packages
chapter</xref>.
</p>
    </preface>
    <section name="bin" >
      <title>Installing the Binary Distribution</title>
      <p>
The binary distribution comes as a Mac OS X installer package (.pkg),
wrapped in a disk image (.dmg).
After downloading the disk image from the
<link url="http://fink.sourceforge.net/download/bindist.php" >download page</link>
(you may have to use your browser's &quot;Save Target as...&quot; or &quot;Download
to Disk&quot; function), double-click it to mount it.
Open the &quot;Fink 0.x.x Installer&quot; disk icon that appears on your desktop
after Disk Copy has verified the file.
Inside you'll find some documentation and a installer package.
Double-click the installer package and follow the instructions on
screen.
</p>
      <p>
You will be asked for an administrator password and shown some texts.
Please read them - they may be more up-to-date than this user's guide.
When the installer prompts you for a drive to install to, be sure to
pick your system volume (the one on which you installed Mac OS X).
If you pick the wrong volume, the install will proceed, but Fink won't
work afterwards.
When the installer is finished, proceed with the
<xref section="setup" >Setting Up Your Environment</xref> section.
</p>
    </section>
    <section name="src" >
      <title>Installing the Source Distribution</title>
      <p>
The source distribution comes as a standard Unix tarball (.tar.gz).
It contains only the <code>fink</code> package manager and its package
descriptions and will download the source for packages on the fly.
You can get it from the
<link url="http://fink.sourceforge.net/download/srcdist.php" >download page</link>.
It is important that you don't use StuffIt Expander to extract the tar
archive.
For some reason StuffIt still can't handle long file names.
If StuffIt Expander already extracted the archive, throw away the
folder it created.
</p>
      <p>
The source release must be installed from the command line, so open
Terminal.app and change to the directory where you put the
fink-0.x.x-full.tar.gz archive.
The following command extracts the archive:
</p>
      <codeblock>tar -xzf fink-0.x.x-full.tar.gz</codeblock>
      <p>
That creates a directory with the same name as the archive.
We'll just keep on using the placeholder <code>fink-0.x.x-full</code>
here.
Now, change into that directory and run the bootstrap script:
</p>
      <codeblock>cd fink-0.x.x-full
./bootstrap.sh</codeblock>
      <p>
The script will run some checks on your system and use sudo to become
root - that will prompt you for your password.
Then, the script will ask you for the installation path.
Unless you have a good reason, you should use the default -
<filename>/sw</filename>.
Only that will allow you to install downloaded binary packages later
on.
Also, all examples use that path; be sure to substitute your actual
path if you use a different one.
</p>
      <p>
Next up is Fink configuration.
You'll be asked for things like proxy and mirror settings and whether
you want verbose messages.
If you don't understand a question, just press return to accept the
default choice.
You can re-run this process later using the <code>fink
configure</code> command.
</p>
      <p>
When the bootstrap script has all the information it needs, it will
start to download the source code for the base system and compile it.
No further interaction should be necessary at this point.
Don't worry if you see some packages being compiled twice.
This is required because to build a binary package of the package
manager, you first must have the package manager available.
</p>
      <p>
When the bootstrap is finished, proceed with the
<xref section="setup" >Setting Up Your Environment</xref> section.
</p>
    </section>
    <section name="setup" >
      <title>Setting Up Your Environment</title>
      <p>
To use the software installed in Fink's directory hierarchy, including
the package management programs themselves, you must set your PATH
environment variable (and some others) accordingly.
In most cases, you can do this via the command
</p>
      <codeblock>open /sw/bin/pathsetup.command</codeblock>
      <p>
However, if that doesn't work for some reason, you can configure it
manually.  This will depend on the shell you are using, however.
You can determine the shell you are using by opening a terminal and
running the command:
</p>
      <codeblock>echo $SHELL</codeblock>
      <p>
 If it says &quot;csh&quot; or &quot;tcsh&quot; in it, you are using the C shell.  If it is
 bash, zsh, sh, or something similar, you are likely running a variant
 of the bourne shell.
</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Bourne Shell</strong> (default on Mac OS X 10.3 and later) </p>
          <p>
   If you use a Bourne style shell (e.g. sh, bash, zsh), add the following
   lines to the file <code>.profile</code> in your home directory (or, if
   you have an existing <code>.bash_profile</code> file, you should use that
   instead):
  </p>
          <codeblock>source /sw/bin/init.sh</codeblock>
          <p>
   If you don't know how to add the line, run these commands:
  </p>
          <codeblock>cd
pico .profile</codeblock>
          <p>
   You are now in a full-screen (well, full terminal window) text editor and
   can simply start typing the <code>source /sw/bin/init.sh</code> line.  It's
   okay if there is a note that says &quot;New file&quot;.  Be sure that you pressed
   Return at least once after the line, then press Control-O, Return,
   Control-X to get out of the editor.
  </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>C Shell</strong> (default on Mac OS X 10.2 and earlier) </p>
          <p>
   If you use tcsh (the default on Mac OS X), add the following line to
   the file <filename>.cshrc</filename> in your home directory:
  </p>
          <codeblock>source /sw/bin/init.csh</codeblock>
          <p>
   If you don't know how to add the line, run these commands:
  </p>
          <codeblock>cd
pico .cshrc</codeblock>
          <p>
   You are now in a full-screen (well, full terminal window) text editor
   and can simply start typing the <code>source /sw/bin/init.csh</code>
   line.
   It's okay if there is a note that says &quot;New file&quot;.
   Be sure that you pressed Return at least once after the line, then
   press Control-O, Return, Control-X to get out of the editor.
  </p>
          <p>There are a couple of common situations where you may need to edit additional files:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>You have a <code>~/.tcshrc</code>.</p>
              <p>Such a file occasionally gets created by third-party applications, or 
  you may have done it yourself.
  In any case what will happen is that <code>~/.tcshrc</code> gets read and 
  <code>~/.cshrc</code> is ignored.
  The recommended procedure is to edit <code>~/.tcshrc</code> in a similar 
  manner to how you edited
  <code>~/.cshrc</code> above, and add the following line at the end:</p>
              <codeblock>source ~/.cshrc</codeblock>
              <p>That way, if you ever need to remove <code>~/.tcshrc</code>, you will be able to run Fink.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>You followed the instructions under <code>/usr/share/tcsh/examples/README</code>.</p>
              <p>These instructions tell you to create a <code>~/.tcshrc</code> and a<code> ~/.login</code> .  The problem in this case is with <code>~/.login</code>, which gets run after <code>~/.tcshrc</code>, and sources <code>/usr/share/tcsh/examples/login</code>.  The latter contains a line that overwrites your previous PATH setup.  What you should do in this case is create <code>~/Library/init/tcsh/path</code>:</p>
              <codeblock>mkdir ~/Library/init
  mkdir ~/Library/init/tcsh
  pico ~/library/init/tcsh/path</codeblock>
              <p>and put:</p>
              <codeblock>source ~/.cshrc</codeblock>
              <p>in it.  You should also modify your .tcshrc as in item 1 above, to make sure that your PATH is set correctly for situations where <code>~/.login</code> doesn't get read.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
  Editing .cshrc (and other startup files) will only affect new shells (i.e. newly opened Terminal
  windows), so you should also run this command in all Terminal windows
  that you opened before you edited the file.
  You'll also need to run <code>rehash</code> because tcsh caches the
  list of available commands internally.
  </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
Note that the scripts also add <filename>/usr/X11R6/bin</filename> and
<filename>/usr/X11R6/man</filename> to your path so you can use X11 when
it is installed.
Fink packages have the ability to add settings of their own, e.g. the
qt package sets the QTDIR environment variable.
</p>
      <p>
Once your environment is set up, proceed to the
<xref chapter="packages" >Installing Packages</xref> chapter to see how
you can install some actually useful packages using the various
package management tools included in Fink.
</p>
    </section>
  </chapter>
  <chapter filename="packages" >
    <title>Installing Packages</title>
    <shorttitle>Packages</shorttitle>
    <preface>
      <p>
Now that you have something that can be called a Fink installation,
this chapter shows you how to install the actual software packages you
came for.
Before we explain how to install packages using either the source or
the binary distribution, some important notes that apply to both.
</p>
    </preface>
    <section name="bin-dselect" >
      <title>Installing Binary Packages with
dselect</title>
      <p>
        <code>dselect</code> is a program that lets you browse the list of
available packages and select which ones you want installed.
It runs inside Terminal.app, but takes over the whole &quot;screen&quot; and
uses simple keyboard navigation.
Like the other package management tools, <code>dselect</code> requires
root privileges, so you must either become root before you start it or
use sudo:
</p>
      <codeblock>sudo dselect</codeblock>
      <p>
        <em>Note:</em>
        <code>dselect</code> has known difficulties with the OSX Terminal application.  You should run the following commands before using it, or put them in the appropriate startup file (e.g. <code>.cshrc</code> | <code>.profile</code>):</p>
      <p>tcsh users:</p>
      <codeblock>setenv TERM xterm-color</codeblock>
      <p>bash users:</p>
      <codeblock>export TERM=xterm-color</codeblock>
      <p>
The main menu has several choices:
</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>[A]ccess</em> - this configures the network access method to use.
<em>You do not need to run this</em>, since Fink pre-configures
everything for you.
Actually, you should avoid this menu item as it may overwrite the
default configuration with one that doesn't work.
</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>[U]pdate</em> - this item downloads the list of available packages
from the Fink site.
This item does not install or update any actual packages, it just
updates the listings used for the package browser.
You must run this at least once after installing Fink.
</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>[S]elect</em> - this gives you the actual package listing, where
you can select and deselect the packages you want on your system.
More about this later.
</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>[I]nstall</em> - this is where the action is.
The menu items above only affect dselect's package listings and status
database.
This one actually goes out and downloads and installs the packages you
have requested.
It also removes the packages you have deselected in the browser.
</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>[C]onfig</em> and <em>[R]emove</em> - these are relics from the
time before apt.
You do not need them, although they won't do harm.
</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>[Q]uit</em> - now that should really be obvious.
</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
You'll spend most of your time with dselect in the package browser,
reachable through the &quot;[S]elect&quot; menu item.
Before dselect shows you the package list, it presents you with an
introductory help screen.
You can press 'k' to get a full listing of keyboard commands, or just
Space to get to the package list.
</p>
      <p>
You can move through the list using the up and down keys.
Selections are made with '+' and '-'.
When you select a package that needs some other packages, dselect will
show you a sublist with the affected packages.
In most cases you can just press Return to accept dselect's choices.
You can also make adjustments in the sublist (e.g. to choose another
alternative for a virtual package dependency), or press 'R'
(i.e. Shift-R) to return to the previous state.
Both the sublists and the main package list are left by pressing
Return.
When you're happy with your selections, leave the main list and use
the &quot;[I]nstall&quot; menu item to actually install the packages.
</p>
    </section>
    <section name="bin-apt" >
      <title>Installing Binary Packages with
apt-get</title>
      <p>
        <code>dselect</code> doesn't actually download the packages itself.
Instead, it runs apt to do the dirty work.
If you prefer a pure command line interface, you can access the
functions of apt directly, with the <code>apt-get</code> command.
</p>
      <p>
Like with dselect, you must first download the current listing of
available packages with this command:
</p>
      <codeblock>sudo apt-get update</codeblock>
      <p>
Like the &quot;[U]pdate&quot; menu item in dselect, this doesn't update the
actual files on your computer, just apt's list of available packages.
To install a package, you just give apt-get the name, like this:
</p>
      <codeblock>sudo apt-get install lynx</codeblock>
      <p>
If apt-get determines that the packages requires other packages to be
installed, it will show you the list and ask for confirmation.
It then downloads and installs the requested packages.
Removing packages is just as easy:
</p>
      <codeblock>sudo apt-get remove lynx</codeblock>
      <p>
<!-- [FIXME: using apt-cache to search for packages] -->      </p>
    </section>
    <section name="bin-exceptions" >
      <title>Installing Dependent Packages that are Unvailable in the Binary Distribution</title>
      <p>Sometimes, when doing a binary install, you may get messages that a dependency can't be installed. e.g.:</p>
      <codeblock>Sorry, but the following packages have unmet
dependencies:
foo: Depends: bar (>= version) but it is
not installable
E: Sorry, broken packages</codeblock>
      <p>What has happened is that the package you are trying to install depends on another package that can't be distributed as a binary, due to licensing requirements.  You must install the dependency from source (see the next section).</p>
    </section>
    <section name="src" >
      <title>Installing Packages from Source</title>
      <p>First of all, you'll need an appropriate version of the Development Tools for your system.  These are available for free download after registration at <link url="http://connect.apple.com" >http://connect.apple.com</link>.</p>
      <p>
To get a list of packages that are available for installation from
source, ask the <code>fink</code> tool:
</p>
      <codeblock>fink list</codeblock>
      <p>
The first column lists the installation state (blank for not
installed, <code>i</code> for installed, <code>(i)</code> for
installed but not the latest version), followed by the package name,
the latest version, and a short description.
You can ask for more information about a specific package using the
&quot;describe&quot; command (&quot;info&quot; is an alias for this):
</p>
      <codeblock>fink describe xmms</codeblock>
      <p>
When you have found a package that you want to install, use the
&quot;install&quot; command:
</p>
      <codeblock>fink install wget-ssl</codeblock>
      <p>
The <code>fink</code> command will first check if all necessary
prerequisites (&quot;dependencies&quot;) are present, and will ask you if it's
okay to install them if some are missing.
Then it goes ahead and downloads source code, unpacks it, patches it,
compiles it, and installs the results on your system.
This can take a long time.
If you run into errors during that process, please first check the
<link url="http://fink.sourceforge.net/faq/" >FAQ</link>.

    <section name="fink-commander">
      <title>Fink Commander</title>
      <p>Fink Commander is an Aqua interface to both <code>apt-get</code> and the <code>fink</code> tool.  The Binary menu lets you do operations on the binary distribution, and the Source menu does the same thing for the source distribution.</p>
      <p>Fink Commander is included with the Fink binary installer.  To download it separately (e.g. if you've bootstrapped Fink from source), or for additional information, visit the <link url="http://finkcommander.sourceforge.net" >Fink Commander website</link>.</p>

    <section>
      <title>Available versions</title>
      <p>When you want to install a package, you should first check the <link url="http://fink.sourceforge.net/pdb/index.php" >package database</link> and see if it is available at all through Fink.  The available version(s) of the package will be shown in several rows of a table.  These are:</p>
      <ul>

    <section name="x11" >
      <title>Getting X11 Sorted Out</title>
      <p>Many of the packages that are available via Fink require the installation of some form of X11.  Because of this, one of the first things that is typically done is to choose an X11 implementation.</p>
      <p>
Since there are several X11 implementations available for Mac OS X
(XFree86, Tenon Xtools, eXodus) and several ways to install them
(manually or via Fink), there are several alternative packages - one
for each setup.
Fink is very bad at guessing what you have, so it's important to pick
the right one and install it before you start installing X11
applications.
Here is a list of the available packages and X11 installation methods:
</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>xfree86-base:</em>
(10.1 or 10.2 only) This package is the real thing.
It installs the whole load of XFree86 4.2.1.1 as a Fink package.
For maximum flexibility, this package does not contain the actual
XDarwin server.
To get that, you should install the xfree86-rootless package.
</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>xfree86:</em>
This is a single package (display server is included) that installs XFree86 4.3.0 (10.2 only), or 4.3.99 (10.3 only).   .
This version is faster than 4.2.1.1, but hasn't been tested quite as much.
</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
system-xfree86:
This package is automatically generated (for Fink 0.6.2 or later) if you install XFree86 manually, either from
source or from the official (or unofficial) binary distribution; or if you install Apple's X11.
It will then act as a
dependency placeholder.
</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
system-xtools:
Install this package if you have Tenon's Xtools product installed.
Like system-xfree86, this will just do a sanity check and leave the
actual files alone.
</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
For more information on installing and running X11, refer to the

and Mac OS X document</link>.

    <title>Upgrading Fink</title>
    <shorttitle>Upgrade</shorttitle>
    <preface>
      <p>
This chapter covers the procedures used to update your Fink
installation with the latest and greatest stuff.
</p>
    </preface>
    <section name="bin" >
      <title>Upgrading using Binary Packages</title>
      <p>
If you use the binary distribution exclusively, there is no separate
upgrade procedure.
Just ask the tool of your choice to get the latest package listing
from the server and let it update all packages.
</p>
      <p>
For dselect, it is sufficient to hit &quot;[U]pdate&quot;, then &quot;[I]nstall&quot;.
Of course, you may want to run &quot;[S]elect&quot; in between to check the
selections that were made and to find out about new packages.
</p>
      <p>
For apt, run <code>apt-get update</code> to get the latest package
list, then <code>apt-get upgrade</code> to update all packages that
have new versions available.
</p>
<p>For Fink Commander, select Binary->Update descriptions to update the package list, and then Binary->Dist-Upgrade packages to update to new versions.</p>
      <p>
For more information, especially about upgrading from Fink versions
older than 0.3.0, see the
<link url="http://fink.sourceforge.net/download/upgrade.php" >Upgrade Matrix</link>.
</p>
    </section>
    <section name="src" >
      <title>Upgrading the Source Distribution</title>
      <p>
Upgrading is a bit more complicated if you use the source
distribution.
The procedure consists of two steps.
In the first step, you download the latest package descriptions to
your computer.
In the second step, these package descriptions are used to compile new
packages; the actual source code is downloaded as needed.
</p>
      <p>
If you have Fink 0.2.5 or later, the first step can be accomplished by
running <code>fink selfupdate</code>.
That command will check with the Fink website to see if a new point
release is available, and will automatically download and install the
package descriptions in that case.
In recent versions of the <code>fink</code> command, you get the
option to pull package descriptions directly from CVS or via rsync.
CVS is a version-controlled repository where the package descriptions
are stored and managed.
Using CVS has the advantage that it is updated continuously, but the disadvantage that there is a single CVS server for Fink, and it can be unreliable if there is a lot of traffic.  For this reason, it is recommended that general users go with rsync.  There are multiple mirrors available for rsync, and the only disadvantage is that package descriptions take an hour or so to migrate to the rsync mirrors after they've been added to CVS.
</p>
      <p>(If you are having trouble upgrading a source installation, consult
<link url="http://fink.sourceforge.net/download/fix-upgrade.php" >these
special instructions</link>.)</p>
      <p>
If you have a version of Fink older than 0.2.5, you must download the
package descriptions manually.
Visit the <link url="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=17203" >download
area</link> and look for the latest packages-0.x.x.tar.gz tarball in
the &quot;distribution&quot; module.
Download it, then install it as follows:
</p>
      <codeblock>tar -xzf packages-0.x.x.tar.gz
cd packages-0.x.x
./inject.pl</codeblock>
      <p>
Once you have updated your package descriptions (no matter which way),
you should update all packages at once with the command <code>fink
update-all</code>.
</p>
<p>To update the source distribution using Fink Commander, select Source->Selfupdate to download new package information files, and then Source->Updata-all to update your outdated packages.</p>
    </section>
    <section name="mix" >
      <title>Mixing Binaries and Source</title>
      <p>
If you use precompiled binary packages for some packages and build
others from source, you'll have to follow both sets of instructions
above to upgrade your Fink installation.
That is, first use <code>dselect</code> or <code>apt-get</code> to get
the latest versions of the packages that are available as binaries,
then use <code>fink selfupdate</code> and <code>fink update-all</code>
to get the current package descriptions and to update the remaining
packages.  If you are using Fink commander, then follow the <xref section="bin">binary</xref> instructions, followed by those for <xref section="src">source</xref>.

    <title>The Fink Configuration File</title>
    <shorttitle>fink.conf</shorttitle>
    <preface>
      <p>
This chapter explains the settings available in the Fink configuration
file (fink.conf) and how they influence the behaviour of Fink, specifically the <code>fink</code> command-line tool (i.e. working with the source distribution).
</p>
    </preface>
    <section name="about" >
      <title>About fink.conf</title>
      <p>
When Fink is initially installed it prompts you for the answers to some
questions to set up your configuration file, such as which <xref section="mirrors" >mirrors</xref> you want to use for downloading files
and how to acquire super-user rights. You can re-run this process by
calling the <code>fink configure</code> command. In order to set some
options, you may need to edit your <em>fink.conf</em> file by hand. In
general, these options are meant for advanced users only.
</p>
      <p>
The <em>fink.conf</em> file is located at
<code>/sw/etc/fink.conf</code>, and can be edited in your favourite
text editor. You will need super-user rights to edit it.
</p>
    </section>
    <section name="syntax" >
      <title>fink.conf syntax</title>
      <p>
Your fink.conf file consists of multiple lines, in the format:</p>
      <codeblock>OptionName: Value</codeblock>
      <p>Options are one per line, and the option name is separated from its
value by a : and a single space. The contents of value depends on the
option, but it is normally either a boolean (&quot;True&quot; or &quot;False&quot;), a
string, or a list of strings delimited by a space. 
For example:
</p>
      <codeblock>
BooleanOption: True
StringOption: Something
ListOption: Option1 Option2 Option3
</codeblock>
    </section>
    <section name="required" >
      <title>Required Settings</title>
      <p>
Some of the settings in the <em>fink.conf</em> are mandatory. Without
them Fink cannot to function properly. The following settings belong to
this category.
</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Basepath:</em> path</p>
          <p>
Tells Fink where it was installed. Defaults to <em>/sw</em> unless you
changed it during the initial installation of Fink. You should
<em>not</em> change this value after installation, it will confuse Fink.
</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section name="optional" >
      <title>Optional User Settings</title>
      <p>
There are various optional settings which users can customize to change
the behaviour of Fink.
</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>RootMethod:</em> su or sudo or none</p>
          <p>For some operations, Fink needs super user rights. Recognized values
are <em>sudo</em> or <em>su</em>. You can also set this to
<em>none</em>, in which case you must run Fink as root yourself. The
default value is <em>sudo</em> and in most cases it should not be
changed.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Trees:</em> list of trees</p>
          <p>Available trees are:</p>
          <codeblock>
local/main      - any local packages you want to install
local/bootstrap - packages used during the installation of Fink
stable/crypto   - stable cryptographic packages
stable/main     - other stable packages
unstable/crypto - unstable cryptographic packages
unstable/main   - other unstable packages
</codeblock>
          <p>
You may also add your own trees in the <code>/sw/fink/dists</code>
directory for your own purposes, but this is not necessary in most
circumstances. The default trees are &quot;local/main local/bootstrap
stable/main&quot;. This list should be kept in sync with the
<code>/sw/etc/apt/sources.list</code> file.
</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Distribution:</em> 10.1 or 10.2</p>
          <p>Fink needs to know which version of Mac OS X you are running. The
10.1 distribution is meant for users of Mac OS X 10.1, while 10.2 will
only work for those who run Mac OS X 10.2 &quot;Jaguar&quot; on their systems.
Mac OS X 10.0 and earlier are not supported. You should not need to
alter this value.
</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>FetchAltDir:</em> path</p>
          <p>usually fink will store the sources it fetches in
<code>/sw/src</code>. You can specify an alernate directory to look for
downloaded source code in using this option. For example:
</p>
          <codeblock>FetchAltDir: /usr/src</codeblock>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Verbose:</em> a number from 0 to 3</p>
          <p>
This option sets how much information Fink tells you about what it is
doing. The values are:
<em>0</em>
            <tt>Quiet</tt> (don't show download stats)
<em>1</em>
            <tt>Low</tt> (don't show tarballs being expanded)
<em>2</em>
            <tt>Medium</tt> (shows almost everything)
<em>3</em>
            <tt>High</tt> (shows everything)
The default value is 3.
</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>NoAutoIndex:</em> boolean</p>
          <p>Fink caches its package descripition files in /sw/var/db/fink.db to
save it having to read and parse them all every time it runs. Fink
checks whether or not thepackage index needs to be updated unless this
option is set to &quot;True&quot;. It defaults to &quot;False&quot; and it is not
recommended that you change it. If you do, you may need to manually run
the <code>fink index</code> command to update the index.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>SelfUpdateNoCVS:</em> boolean</p>
          <p>The command <code>fink selfupdate</code> upgrades Fink package
manager to the latest release. This option makes sure that the
Concurrent Version System (CVS) is not used to achieve this when set to
<tt>True</tt>. It is set automatically by the <code>fink
selfupdate-cvs</code> command, so you should not need to change it
manually.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section name="downloding" >
      <title>Download Settings</title>
      <p>There are various settings which influence the way Fink downloads
package data.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>ProxyPassiveFTP:</em> boolean</p>
          <p>This option makes Fink use &quot;passive&quot; mode for FTP downloads. Some
FTP server or network configurations require this option to be set to
<tt>True</tt>. It is recommended that you leave this option on at all
times since active FTP is deprecated.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>ProxyFTP:</em> url</p>
          <p>If you use a FTP proxy then you should enter its address here, for
example:</p>
          <codeblock>ProxyFTP: ftp://yourhost.com:2121/</codeblock>
          <p>Leave if blank if you do not use a FTP proxy.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>ProxyHTTP:</em> url</p>
          <p>If you use a HTTP proxy then you should enter its address here, for
example:</p>
          <codeblock>ProxyHTTP: http://yourhost.com:3128/</codeblock>
          <p>Leave if blank if you do not use a HTTP proxy.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>DownloadMethod:</em> wget or curl or axel or axelautomirror</p>
          <p>Fink can use three different applications to download files from the
Internet - <em>wget</em>, <em>curl</em>, or <em>axel</em>. The value
<em>axelautomirror</em> uses an experimental mode of the <em>axel</em>
application which tries to determine the closest server that has a
certain file. The use of <em>axelmirror</em> is not recommended at this
time. The default value is <em>curl</em>.
<em>The application you chose as DownloadMethod MUST be installed!</em>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section name="mirrors" >
      <title>Mirror Settings</title>
      <p>Getting software from the Internet can be tedious thing and often
downloads are not as fast as we would like them to be. Mirror servers
host copies of files available on other servers, but may have a faster
connection to the Internet or be geographically closer to you, thus
enabling you to download files faster. They also help reduce load on
busy primary servers, for example <em>ftp.gnu.org</em>, and they
provide an alternative should one server not be reachable.</p>
      <p>In order for Fink to pick the best mirror for you, you must tell it
which continent and which country you reside in. If downloads from one
server fail, it will prompt you if you want to retry from the same
mirror, a different mirror in the same country or continent, or a
different mirror anywhere in the world.</p>
      <p>The <em>fink.conf</em> file holds settings about which mirrors you
would like to use.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>MirrorContinent:</em> three letter code</p>
          <p>You should change this value using the <code>fink configure</code>
command. The three letter code is one found in
<code>/sw/lib/fink/mirror/_keys</code>.
For example, if you live in europe:</p>
          <codeblock>MirrorContinent: eur</codeblock>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>MirrorCountry:</em> six letter code</p>
          <p>You should change this value using the <code>fink configure</code>
command. The three letter code is one found in
<code>/sw/lib/fink/mirror/_keys</code>.
For example, if you live in Austria:</p>
          <codeblock>MirrorCountry: eur-AT</codeblock>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>MirrorOrder:</em> MasterFirst or MasterLast or MasterNever or ClosestFirst</p>
          <p>
Fink supports 'Master' mirrors, which are mirrored repositories of the source
tarballs for all Fink packages. The advantage of using the Master mirror set is that 
the source download URLs will never break. Users can choose to use 
these mirrors which are maintained by the Fink team, or to use only the original 
source URLs and external mirror sites such as the gnome, KDE, and debian mirror sites.
Additionally users can choose to combine the two sets, which are then searched in proximity order, as 
documented above. When using the MasterFirst or MasterLast options, the user can 'skip ahead' 
to the Master (or non Master) set if a download fails. The options are:
</p>
          <codeblock>
MasterFirst - Search &quot;Master&quot; source mirrors first.
MasterLast - Search &quot;Master&quot; source mirrors last.
MasterNever - Never use &quot;Master&quot; source mirrors.
ClosestFirst - Search closest source mirrors first (combine all mirrors into one set).

      <title>Developer Settings</title>
      <p>Some options in the <em>fink.conf</em> are only useful to

    <section name="using" >
      <title>Using the fink tool</title>
      <p>The <code>fink</code> tool uses several suffix comands to work on packages from the source distribution. 
Some of them need at
least one package name, but can handle several package names at
once. You can specify just the package name (e.g. gimp), or a fully
qualified name with a version number (e.g. gimp-1.2.1 or
gimp-1.2.1-3). Fink will automatically choose the latest available
version and revision when they are not specified.  Others have different options.</p>
      <p>What follows is a list of the commands for the <code>fink</code> tool:</p>
    </section>
    <section name="install" >
      <title>install</title>
      <p>The install command is used to install packages. It downloads,
configure, builds and installs the packages you name. It will also
install required dependencies automatically, but will ask you for
confirmation before it does so. Example:</p>
      <codeblock>fink install nedit

Reading package info...
Information about 131 packages read.
The following additional package will be installed:
 lesstif
Do you want to continue? [Y/n]</codeblock>
      <p>Aliases for the install command: update, enable, activate, use (most
of these for historic reasons).</p>
    </section>
    <section name="remove" >
      <title>remove</title>
      <p>The remove command removes packages from the system by calling '<code>dpkg --remove</code>'. The current implementation has some flaws: It only works on
packages the <code>fink tool</code> knows about (i.e. where an .info file is present); and it
doesn't check dependencies itself but rather completly leaves that to
the dpkg tool (usually this poses no problem, though).</p>
      <p>The remove command only removes the actual package files, but leaves
the .deb compressed package file intact. This means that you can
re-install the package later without going through the compile process
again. If you need the disk space, you can remove the .deb from the
<filename>/sw/fink/dists</filename> tree.</p>
      <p>Aliases: disable, deactivate, unuse, delete.</p>
    </section>
    <section name="update-all" >
      <title>update-all</title>
      <p>This command updates all installed packages to the latest version. It
does not need a package list, so you just type:</p>
      <codeblock>fink update-all</codeblock>
    </section>
    <section name="list" >
      <title>list</title>
      <p>
This command produces a list of available packages, listing
installation status, the latest version and a short description.
If you call it without parameters, it will list all available
packages.
You can also pass a name or a shell pattern, and fink will list all
packages that match.
</p>
      <p>
The first column displays the installation state with the following
meanings:
</p>
      <codeblock>
     not installed
 i   latest version is installed
(i)  installed, but a newer version is available
</codeblock>
      <p>
There are also some flags for the <code>fink list</code> command
</p>
      <codeblock>
-h,--help
	  Show the options which are available.
-t,--tab
	  Output the list in a tab delimited format, useful for
	  running the output through a script.
-i,--installed
	  Show only those packages which are currently installed.
-o,--outdated
	  Show only those packages which are out of date.
-u,--uptodate
	  Show only packages which are up to date.
-n,--notinstalled
	  Show packages which are not currently installed.
-s=expr,--section=expr
	  Show only packages in the sections matching the regular
	  expression expr.
-w=xyz,--width=xyz
	  Sets the width of the display you would like the output
	  formatted for. xyz is either a numeric value or auto.
	  auto will set the width based on the terminal width.
	  The default is auto.
</codeblock>
      <p>
Some usage examples:
</p>
      <codeblock>
fink list                 - list all packages
fink list bash            - check if bash is available and what version.
fink list --outdated      - list packages which are out of date
fink list --section=kde   - list the packages in the kde section
fink list &quot;gnome*&quot;         - list all packages that start with 'gnome'
</codeblock>
      <p>
The quotes in the last example are necessary to stop the shell from
interpreting the pattern itself.
</p>
    </section>
    <section name="apropos" >
      <title>apropos</title>
      <p>
This command behaves almost identical to <code>fink list</code>. The most
notable difference is that <code>fink apropos</code> also searches
the package descriptions to find packages. The second difference is that 
the search string must be supplied and is not optional.
</p>
      <codeblock>
fink apropos irc          - list all packages for which 'irc' occurs in the name or description
fink apropos -s=kde irc   - the same as above, but restricted to packages from the kde section
</codeblock>
    </section>
    <section name="describe" >
      <title>describe</title>
      <p>
This command displays a description of the package you name on the
command line.
Note that only a small part of the packages currently have a
description.
</p>
      <p>
Aliases: desc, description, info
</p>
    </section>
    <section name="fetch" >
      <title>fetch</title>
      <p>Downloads the named packages, but does not install it. This command
will download the tarballs even if they were downloaded before.</p>
    </section>
    <section name="fetch-all" >
      <title>fetch-all</title>
      <p>Downloads <em>all</em> package source files. Like fetch, this downloads the
tarballs even when they were downloaded before.</p>
    </section>
    <section name="fetch-missing" >
      <title>fetch-missing</title>
      <p>Downloads <em>all</em> package source files. This command will only download
files that are not present on the system.</p>
    </section>
    <section name="build" >
      <title>build</title>
      <p>Builds a package, but does not install it. As usual, the source
tarballs are downloaded if they can not be found. The result of this
command is an installable .deb package file, which you can quickly
install later with the install command. This command will do nothing
if the .deb already exists. Note that dependencies are still
<em>installed</em>, not just built.</p>
    </section>
    <section name="rebuild" >
      <title>rebuild</title>
      <p>Builds a package (like the build command), but ignores and overwrites
the existing .deb file. If the package is installed, the newly created
.deb file will also be installed in the system via <code>dpkg</code>. Very useful
during package development.</p>
    </section>
    <section name="reinstall" >
      <title>reinstall</title>
      <p>Same as install, but will install the package via <code>dpkg</code> even when it is
already installed. You can use this when you accidentally deleted
package files or changed configuration files and want to get the
default settings back.</p>
    </section>
    <section name="configure" >
      <title>configure</title>
      <p>
Reruns the Fink configuration process.
This will let you change your mirror sites and proxy settings, among
others.
</p>
    </section>
    <section name="selfupdate" >
      <title>selfupdate</title>
      <p>
	This command automates the process of upgrading to a new Fink
	release. It checks the Fink website to see if a new version is
	available. It then downloads the package descriptions and updates
	the core packages, including <code>fink</code> itself. This command can upgrade
	to regular releases, but it can also setup your <filename>/sw/fink/dists</filename>
	directory tree for direct CVS updates.  This means that you then
	will be able to access the very latest revisions of all packages.
</p>
    </section>
    <section name="index" >
      <title>index</title>
      <p>
   Rebuilds the package cache. You should not normally need to execute
   this manually, as <code>fink</code> should auto-detect when it needs to be updated.
</p>
    </section>
    <section name="validate" >
      <title>validate</title>
      <p>
   This command performs various checks on .info and .deb files. Package
   maintainers should run this on their package descriptions and
   corresponding built packages before submitting them.
</p>
      <p>
   Aliases: check
</p>
    </section>
    <section name="scanpackages" >
      <title>scanpackages</title>
      <p>
   Calls dpkg-scanpackages(8) with the specified trees.
</p>
    </section>
    <section name="checksums" >
      <title>checksums</title>
      <p>
   Validates the MD5 digest of all tarballs in <code>/sw/src</code>, where possible.
</p>
    </section>
    <section name="cleanup" >
      <title>cleanup</title>
      <p>
   Removes obsolete package files (.info, .patch, .deb) if newer versions are available. 
   This can reclaim large amounts of disk space.
